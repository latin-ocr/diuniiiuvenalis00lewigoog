362 NOTES.
aulus are the words used lor fear of the gods, meracas dictem
matertera, Pers. ii 31· Deam metatu, porculum amorem ci coy-
aalam concordiam, Plaut. Amphit. ii 2 211, which illustrates
. thie very clearly. So metirent jas, ror below, and timidas
Deorum, Or. Met. v 100. 97: -The Jews were supposed
to worship the slries, probably from their religion not allowing
any image of the deity, Tac. Hist. v 5, who says the same of
the Germane, Germ. 9 ; aud Strabo, accordingly, represents
Moses as teaching that there was oue God, ὀ καλοῦμεν οὐρανὸν
καί κόσμον και· τὴν τῶι lieo· picti, xvi, p 761 ; so also Dion, bc.
dedito sacris Incerti aalma Dei, Lucan, ii 59²· In the fragment
ol Petronius quoted 011 vi 160, it is said of the Jew, nt coeli
mammos advocat auriculae, which Lipsius understands‚ “quasi
putarent coelum aures habere idque invocarent.'' But the
allusion in caraulas is to the ass’s head which the Jews were
Ι supposed to worship, Tac. Hist. v 3 4 (and ci. Plant. Sympos.
ir), a calumny which is refutcd by Josephue, Minucius Felix
and Tertullian, Somaioetie caput asininam cese Deam aeostrnm
. . . olqac eta iada praesumptam opiaor, nos quoquc at Jadoicac
rdiya'oaa’e propietates cidem simulacro initiari, Tertull. Apol 16.
Hence, the Christiane, who were coufounded with them, were
called “asinarii :” a curious illustration ol which was brought
to light not many years ago in the shape of a caricature dis-
covered at Rome, and representing the founder oiChristianity
on a cross with an ass's head* 98: vi 160. Compare
with the whole of this passage the sketch which Tacitus gives
ol the Jews in the opening clrapters of the fifth book of his
History. 103: monstrare aios, To point out the roadto
a traveller, is commonly instanced as au example of what is
due from one man to another, Proecioiemas al naufrago monam
porrigat, creanti aiom monstratrum esuriente portem suurn dividat?
Seu. Epp. 95. Ennius quoted by Cic. Off. ii: audeo among*
the precepta oi Mahomet, “to put a traveller on the right
road ;'’ Bosworth Smith, “ Mahometanism‚'' p. 20. The unsoci-

* Mr. (now Dean) Merivale disputes this interpretation oi the caricature,

“History of the Romans‚” vol. vi. c. 59. Howerer, to go into this ques·
tion would altogether exceed my scope. Mr. King in his work on antique
geme also refers to the subject. See alubi, Persecutions de l'Egliee, ii. 96,

ior a tull discussion oi the matter.
