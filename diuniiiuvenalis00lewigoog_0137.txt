Vestam minorem, i.e., compared with the temple at Rome.

oi mon.'' Picens, the fishmmnn, because Ancona was -in
Picenum. 66: privatis mojorasocis; ci. iii 203, note. prio.
means here “for any but that of a sovereign.'' 67: stom-
achum latrare rapinis, the same meaning as ventrem mpimre.
Jahn reads here supinae with the sense ‘⁴ relieve your stomach
(by emetics)‚ to malre way for the fish.” If there uere MS.
authority sor this, it would be preferable. Ovell. compares
the construction with Hor. Sat. ii 6 83. ut tumea crtum rol-
ουτοι hospitiis calmum. 69: Ipse copi coluit. 1 have often
thought that this might be a parody on Martial, ix. 32 5.

Here again, Juvenal may not impossibly have had in view

Emperor.” pot. was common in this sense ata later period,
