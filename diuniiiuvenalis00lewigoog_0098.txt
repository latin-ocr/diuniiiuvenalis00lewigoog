SA TIRE ΙΙΙ. 77

and gets hustled and knocked about, and trampled upon and

Here the vruggon containing Umbricius’ furniture comes up,
arrd the friends part, Umbricius concluding nith en offer to
leave Cumae (the destined place of his retirement) aud to
visit Juvenal at Aquinum, uben next he goes there, for the

’ purpose of assisting him in his Satires.

“This Satire,'' says Maricam, “may have been written
about the same timeas the last, but it is impossible to say.''
This really sums up all that can be said, nith any advantage,
on the subject. lt has been supposed that siccandum elect-zena
at 32, and 307, refer to the uorlss undertakeu by tlre Emperor
Trajan in the Pomptine hlarshes, but‘this is very doubtful.

If Isacia, 74, esis probable, refer to the person mentioned by Τ f,
the younger Pliny, u'e should have a faint indication that ²
that passage at all events nas not u’ritten before the reign ’χ

of Nerva. For Pliny Epp. ii 3, evidently speaks of Isaeus
as newly arrived in Rome: raroque Isaeum forato praecesserat

l nrojor inventos est, and in the epistle next but one preceding

he refers to the public funeral of Virginius Rufus. Now,
Virginius Rufus died in mn. 97. This indication would
indeed be of more value if l'liuyhad not expressly told us
that lre did not profess to observe any order of time in
publishing his collection of letters.

The Satire, like several others, has, l think, been added to ¹
at subsequen periods by the author.
