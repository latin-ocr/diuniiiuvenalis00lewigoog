even for the senate of old days Macleane readers, “ lor our - .
senate when it had grown to be luxurious,'' which is not,I

think, the sense. Juvenal's respect for the senate has been -

shown at 29. 78: Oivrias, ii 3, note. The poet may have
had in his mind Seneca de Cous ad llelv. 10, Scilicet minae
beate vivebat dictator vtostcr, qai Samnitum leyatos audit, cam
vilissimam cibam ia soca ipse mana saa versaret? But tha
story vas a common one, and is told by Seneca agaim de
Provid. 3, and with variations by Valet. Maxim. iv 3 5, as
vell as by Plutarch, Cicero, and others. The diminutivcs
should be observed here, parvo, brevitas, olaeada Compare

Dictator trudging back from work, his spade on his shoulder,
“ a little earlier than usual,’' to such a diuner, isin the poet’s

best manner. Compare Hor. Od. iii637, sqq, rusticorammae· ⁸
