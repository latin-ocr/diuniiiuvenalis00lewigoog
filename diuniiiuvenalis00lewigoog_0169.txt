143 latrone-'cnon' To SATIRE ΓΙ.

madness3 they poison their stepsons, and their own sons,

too, sometimes. They are worse than the heroines of tragie
. story, Medea, Clytaemnestra, and the like, because they com-

rnit their deeds of guilt in eold blood, and not in a frenzy of

passion, with subtle poison in place of the rude axe.

As to the date ol this Satire, ne hare a few indications
which may help to guide us. (ι.) The headdress mentioned ,
st 5ο2 sqq. (see note) is one which certainly seems, from an
inspection of coins, to have heen in fashion during the reigns
of Trajan and Hadrian, and not generally before, nor alter
these reigns. (2.) Lines 407-411 may refer to Trajan's Ar-

} menian and Parthian expeditione, and to the earthqunke at ,

Antioch in an. 1¹5· (3.) ln 2ο5 coins are spoken of, bearing
the inscription “Desinis et Gennoaicus.” No sneh coins of
'Domitian's reign hare been fonnd3 while thero exist some
of T rejan’s. (4.) The castration of males is spoken os in 366
sqq This practice was forbidden by Domitian end Nerva,
and may have revived. (5.) Archia genes is spoken oi as a dis·

These indicat' t,10ns though not perhaps of very great weig ‹rht '
when taken sin ly, yet tconsidered collectively, and ιιι con·

junet ion with what we‘r gather from the other Satires, will
leave small doubt that this one was published' ιιι the reign
of Trajan or the earlier part ol that of Hadrian.
