he was olyran aetate, Tac. Hist ii 86. Our author is not always
remarkable for historical accuracy. This man, in later life,
liad become a courtier ol Domitian, and so the poet sueers at
him; it is onlya sneer, no worse. The same remark may
be applied to Montanus 107, of whom all that we know other·

there) is very favourable meditatur proella accurs at vii 128,

together by Pliny, Epp. iv 22, where the lucteris spoken of
as luminibus orbatus. He was blind. It has, however, heeu
held by some commentators that he could not have been
entirely deprived of sight, otherwise his praise of the turbot,
119 sqq, could not have pleased the tyrant. But those who
indulge in this sort of criticism, seem to me not to appreheud
the manner of Juvenal, especially the whole tone of this
Satira. He often introduces his most ponerful effects, re-

The commentatore all take this to mean, “formerly a common

beggar at the bridges, now a dreaded satellite of the tyrant.”
The bridges seem to have been favourite statione for mendi-
cants, v 8 and xiv. 134, where aliquis de ponite is used for “a
beggar.'' In sublicium pontem rna transfer, et inter eyrntes abjice,

lose a great deal of their force. Ι think satelles a pionte means
