Servate, “La arcad corneti? 146: attonitos ei festinare
coactos. This very closely resembles an expression in Pliny's
Panegyr. c 48, who tells us that those who were summoned
to Domitian’s councils, went there attoniti, at periculam capitia
addoni tarditate. 147: Cotti and Sicambri, German tribes,
ci. Dict G. and R. Geog. Domitian led an army against the
¹ former. 148: diuersis, Ι have translated “opposita''
which l think is the meaning here. Compare vii 156, quac
veniant diversa parta ancittae, and note. 149: anaia applied
to a letter, cs. vi 6 57 note. When a general transmitted news
of a victory to the Senate, a bay-leaf was stuclr in the letter. -
atheo est a Caesare Iovarus, Pers. vi 43. Literac a Posthamio

scholiast adds that when news of a defeat was conveyed, a
feather was inserted3 but there is no authority thatI know
of sor this, unless it has been inferred from Stat. Silv. v 1 9²
93. Probably the expression means merely “on hurried
wing.”

150: sqq. Α similar change from a jocular tone to one
ol deep earnestness occurs at vi 3 35. Atque atinam ritas aeterra
at publico saltant His intacta molis agerentur sacra. There is an
emphasis on tota. Would, says the poet, that he had devoted
the robola of his time to such tom-foolery only. The names
of some of these distinguished men whom this contemptible
tyrant put to death, on frivolous pretenta, are given by Sueto·
nius, Domit. 10. 153: cerdonibus, low journeymen, riti-rati ,
(according to Forc. a name given to slaves, cf. Pers. iv 51,
(inninga), used as a synonym for the vulgar, aa auton iii 294.
Martial joins the two, sator cerdo, iii 59 and iii 16, Das aladi-
atoras sutorum requie cerdo. The meaning is, that though
Domitian might murder the nobles with impunity, he fell as
soon as he began to be an object oi apprehension to the
vulgar. Some of these obscure people whom he put to death Ι
are mentioned by Suetonius 3 an actor, a gladiator, scribes,
nc. This line has often been applied to Robespierre, and*
correctly, if we accept him as the representative ol the

system ol government kuowu as the Rcign of Terror.
