Wtat became os thia mart? He was able to write
poetry which imposed upon his contemporaries as that 31
3 great genius (in some respecta the greatest satirical
genius the world has ever seen) just deceased; and his
impostore has lasted for eighteen centuries. Whatever
his laults may have been, he was certainly-Juvenal
being dead-the greatest 11313311 poet 31 his day. We
should have thought that, especially alter this suecess-
ful attempt, we should have had something from him

under his own name. Nothing 31 the kind. There was ,·

living iu Rome at the beginning 31 the second century a
man capable 31 writing verses which should be a heritage
131311 time; we get, so to speak,a momentary glimpse
of him composing these verses (destined to lire lor ever,
and in parts to delight 131 3131) undere 13133 name, in
combination with a dishonest bookseller. He never wrote
anything more, or, if 113 did, it 1133 never come down to
us. Alter this anparalleled achievement, he sinks baek
into the darkness from which hc has emerged Either
this difficulty must be laced, or tho alternative must be ·
adopted 31 accepting Ribbeck's view of the “ spurious ’'
satiras—that they are “a collection 31 school trash;” the
work of “a shallow babbler‚ an impostor, who thinks like
asoap-boiler‚ not even capable 31 seizing aud fashioning
one single true thought.’' In that case, 31 course, there
would have been as many poetasters in Rome capable 31
luruishing them to order as there are persons in London·
prepared to write lor llcssrs. Moses& Son. Our surprise
will be transferred to the Romans, who could be so easily
deceived3 but it will be a surprise unmixed with eon·
ternpt for their want of toste aud acumen, since we, too,
have shared in the delusion.
