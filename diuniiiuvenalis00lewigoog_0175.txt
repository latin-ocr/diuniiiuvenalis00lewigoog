by Martial in a number oi passages. Oajas ac spiritus

For this sense of farao, cl. 408. Ol course, the personageis

where, living in a remote country-house. Well, let her live
in a little bit oi a 'country-town, and preserve her chastity
even there, and I will grant all that you plesse to say about
her. I will give in to all that you tell us about her conduct
in the paternal country-house. 'casta est qaam aomo royaoit, as
Ovid puts it. For the same sentiment, Oia varadati 16.

from Rome (Castel Giubileo). The two are coupled together,

Horace, who uses their names in the same way, Gabiis desertior

public walks, covered in, as a protection from rain and heat,
’ supported by columns, at least on one side, cf. Dict Gr. and
R. Ant. “Porticus'' They answered the same purpose, no
doubt, as the “ Arcades '’ in Paris. Rich men had such walks
oi their own, on a smaller scale, iv 6. Ouid frequently speaks
