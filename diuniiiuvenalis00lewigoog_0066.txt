sarrae 1. 43

..ι-...-

Some real erent is probably alluded to, after the poet’s
manner. Tho usual way of rendering is, that the master,
haring lost all his money, is unable to give his slarea
nen tunic, and is forced to let him go shivering in his
old one, or without one. In this ease reddere is not
simply equivalent to dare, as Ruperti hesit, but has tho
sense of to “replace,’' exactly as we should say, “lle ean·
not alfard to replace his footman's old livery by a new
¹ one,'' ie, when the new lircry is due. . . . If this senso
be preferred, an identical use of the nord occnrs in Plaut.
Most. i 27, where the tiles, da, ofa house being blon'n off,
the master nill not replace them-Dominus indiliyeae reddere
aliae aceoli. . . . “ffeddae non est idem ae restituere ab
alio qnod acceperis, nec dare simpliciter, sed dare ea quae
propter qualemcunque causam debentur iis quihus dantur,
aut ad eos quocunque modo pertinent,” Orell. ad Hor. Epp.
ii 1 2163 and this would cnaetly suit the sense here, if the
latter rendering be preferred. reddant ara caterinae, iii 202,
“gire what is expected of them:” arilei redditae eilaf literae
ierac, Plin. Epp. i 8: ebliyafam relide dori dement, Har. Od. ii
7 17: eoa reddita tolidem, l'aler. Flacc. i 209: reddere jara, are
instances of this force of ealdcre, which is also used in the
same sense of land. The re in eompounds has often this
force redditas is frequently used in Lueret. for “assigned as
a property.” Professor llunro indeed says that reddere in
Lucret. is often equit-alent to deire, but in every instance the
force of re seems plainly discernible. See, for example, the ¹
two cases particularly cited by him, ii 228 and 890. How-
ever, the former explanation seems preferable. 94: seacula
were a kind of morable trays, fitted on to the tops of the
tables‚ and containing “a course,” as we should term it.
They were changed nith each successive conrse. This
appears from the discorrries at Pompeii: enneae fercula
nostrae Malim certadeie qnam placuisse cquis, Mart. ix 82.

95: sqq. seem rather abruptly introduced. spa-cala. cf.
Dict G. and n. Ant. It will suffice here to say that it nas a
“dole’' or gratuity distributed hy rich rnen te their clients,
sometimes in the shape of a small portien of foed, sometimes
