to expositam and triciale here, as Orellius observes ad lou 55:

Orat. 9 aud 12 where nemora et leui are spoken ol astho
resort ol poets3 and the passages are remarkable, as having
served to identiiy tho author of the treatise. Compare Pliny
to Tacitus Epp. ix 10. This passage recalls one in Ovid.
Trist i 1, which was, I think, in Juvenal’s mind, Carmina
aureatam auimo dedueta sereno . . . Carmina secessum scribentis
et otia quaerunt. . . Carminibus metris orunis abest ,· and compare
with 69-71, Da mihi alhreouiden, et tot circumspice casus, ingenium
ι tantis eacidetoruae malis. 62:3atur-Euoe, quoted by Sidon.

66: sqq. The reference is to the Aeneid, of which Juvenal
x uas a great admirer. The Rutuliau is Turnus, and Erinnys
is Alecto, whom Juno sont to intlame his jealousy against
Aeneas. The Furies (of whom she was one) uere represented
with snakes in their hair, and aro so described by Aeschylus
in the Eumenides, penninos erexit crinitus auyrus, Virg. Aen.

caderent, “would have falleu.” hir. Simoox gives (from Mad·

ι vig) several examples os the use of the imperfect in this way, π
Nm tam facile opes Carthaginis concidissent uisi illud acceptandum
classibus nostris pateret, Cic. in l'err. ii 1,—“Carthage would

, not have fallen so easily if we had not had Sicily open to our
fleets.'' Persas Indosque aliasque si Alexander adjunxisset yantas,
impedimentum mayis quam auxilium traiceret, Liv. ix 19,-“If
Alexander had enrolled these tribes, he would have had more
burden to drag thau help.'' The present is similarly used ‘
iu such a phrase aelisam tu igitur Opimium, si tum esses, temera

'rium ciuem aut crudelem putes, Cio. Phil. viii 4 (also quoted). ,
A good example, twice repeated, may be added from Virg.
