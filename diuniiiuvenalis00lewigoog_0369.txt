Ithink he is right. Hodgson, iu his translation, gives tho

Though these follows deny their debt, they are rolling in

book he says that the famous ring that Polycrates threw into

you have come into the world under exceptional circum-
stancesl'' There is also, no doubt, a reference to white as a ¹
lucky colour. Il Juvenal had read, or remembered, the above
passage in Columella, he might perhaps have given a different
illustration, since that writer represents white hens as being ¹
particularly liable to be pounced upon by “ hawks ” and birds
of prey, from being more easily seen.
