vi 79, where rapa means “a pnrse‚’' seems to think it may ’
have the same meaning here, which, to me, is quite incon·
ceivable, though this interpretation has the authority of
*casaubon aud Koenig. Professor Conington, whose pas-
thumous editiones Persius has only just been given to the

misunderstood the meaning herote be ‘makes you frown

the introductiones the same word into the two passages, is
more than an accident. Professor Conington, in his excel·
lent notes, often refers to difficult passages of Juvenal, ca pa,

lx 34, and by Plin, H. N. xxxii πο, who mentions him after
Crassus, to whom he assigns about A1,600,000 in lauded
property. But these figures are no more to be depended ou '
than the numbers of the slaughtered iu the ancient battles.
