Gallam Juvenal seems to have loolred on Galba with some
degree ol favour, vi 5 59, viii 222. This may have been owing

ground for this partiality may have been that Galba recalled
Thrasea from banishment, cf. v 36. Juvenal probably hated
the whole Flavian family, typifred, in his eyes, by Domitian.
