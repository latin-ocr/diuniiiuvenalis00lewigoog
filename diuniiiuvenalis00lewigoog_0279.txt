185 τ Damasippc. The name is used here lor that oi any man
of birth and fortune who had ruined himself. It had no
doubt become proverbial from Horace, whose works, in
Juvenal's time, were text-books, vii 226 227, and familiar to .
educated men from boyhood. Damasippus, a broken spend· .

thrift, is introduced as talking with Horace all through Sat.
ii 3. There was a living original of the character mentioned
by Oicero, ad Fam. vii 233 ad Att. xii ²9· Probably from
consumptis (pibus here, some of the transcribers have taken

this as a continuation of the preceding passage, and hence ·

Damasippus has been substituted ior Lateranus. 186: ·
siparia, literally the “ drop-scenc,'' or ‘⁴ stage-curtain,'’ hence,
metaph, “the stage.’' The Phacum (cauea), or “canosa”
appears to have been a sarae, written by Catullus the play·
wright (and who must not be conlounded with the celebrated
poet). We know nothing certain ol the farce, or its author.
Menander wrote a play with the sarna title, of which a Latin
version was given in Terence's time, Idem illcrraudri Phasma
³ uuucmcpcrdcdit, Ter. Eun. Prol. 9. But elegance appears to
have been the distinguishing mark ol Menander's comediee, and
it is difficolt to trace anyconncction between a productiori ol' hie
aad the uoisy (clamosum.) larce alluded to in the text3 unless
it were a burlesque of the original. Catullus is again men·
tioned at xiii 111, and by Mart. v 30, facundi sceau Catulli.
187: Laureolum, “the hero ol a larce” (also by Catullus,
according to Tertull. adv. Valent. 14), a robber who was
crucified on the stage. Juvenal says Lentulus acted the
character so much to the lile that he oughtto have been
crucified in reality, not in mere show. This appears to have
been actually douc in some cases, Nuda Caledonio sic uisura ,
praebuit urso, Noa sarisa prudeus ia cruce laureatus, biart. Sp. 7.
189 : srous durior, as ac durissimum in Cic. fraus is here, aa
often, “ sbame,'' “a sense of shame ;’' exclamat illeliccrta perissa
Frontem dc rubus, Pers. v 1'033 Aac cum perfricuit frontem,
poscatque pudorem, Mart. xi 27 7. 190: triscurria, “buf-
fooueries ol tho lowest kiucl,'' tri having, as in several other
words, an intensive meaning: trifurcifer, Plaut. Rud. iii 4 293
triucmsice, or tcrceucficc, Bacch. iv 6 15, quoted by Britannicus.
Also, trisur and tracuus in the same poet, and trivortcalum in
