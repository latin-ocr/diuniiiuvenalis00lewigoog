sarrae vr. 153

peccantiam cmhojustcpotestas, Hor. Sat. ii 7 59, sqq. We can

easily imagine that some such scene would be os frequent occur· ’

rence in farrea, and that Latinus, as a favourite actor, would
often have to jump into a chest, or other place of concealrnent,
to avoid the fury ol the outraged husband. perituri I talre
to mean “iu danger of his life,'’ aa, in the farae, and not
“destined to perish,'' in allusion to Latinus being put to
death by Nero, or his namesake by Domitian. The former
meaning is much more in nnison with the context, and cer·
tainly iu better taste. This participle often has the sense
which Heinrich would give to terram creditura, iv 10, “at the
risk of,” dra, and perhaps to cariturus, above 39. For a good
example comp. Virg. Aen. xi 741, where moriturus is applied
to one who is not destined to die. The meaning here evidently
is “ a man who has had such experience os Latinus's chest”
(just as we might say, “of Falstaff's clothes-basket”), Met,
for “a man who has had so many int-rigues with married
women.” 45: Quid, quod, “why add that‚'' “nay, more,'’

day has a note (referred to by hlacleane) in which he cites the
authority of Paulus Aegineta, a medical writer oi the seventh
century, to the effect that avein in the forehead was called
media. “Bleed him well,” is the meaning. 47: Delicias
