1, 2: salicis praemia militiae, “ the advantages oi military
life, if itha successful,'' Macleane. 1 think this rendering

rather weakens the passage; “ of lucky military service ’' is .

preferable. 2: Quodsi. This reading is preserved by Pri-
scian. The MSS. have etamsi. The former is much better.
“What a lucky trade is that of the soldier, in general!
