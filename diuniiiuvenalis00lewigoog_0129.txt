THE subject 01 this Satire, 10 which is prefixed a kind 01
introduction (1-36), which has 1101 much to do with it, and
which deals with the vices 01 the upstart court-lavemini,-
Crispinus, is as follows :—

A turbat 01 unusual 1110 has been caught iu the nets 01 a
fisherman at Ancona. The man determines 10 make a pre·
100101 11 10 the Emperor, being quite sure thatil he does
not do 10 11 will be seized upon 1011110 imperial table. So
off 110 starts 101 Alba, where Domitian holds his court. The
Emperor is pleascd with the lish and with the speech which
the fisberman makes en presenting it ; and finding that he .
has no dish large enough 10 contaiu 11, summons his oourtiers
to a couucil. In they come, Pegasus, Crispus, Acilius, 110, ’
and this gives the poet the opportunity 01 passing them iu
review and having a lling at each 01 them. At last, on the
proposition 01 Montanus, it is decided that a special dish shall
be forthwith made to contaiu 1110 turbet. The couucil 111111-
missed and the scene closes.

And would, says Juvenal, that Domitian had never been
guilty 01 anything worse thau such absurd tomlooleries as
these, The tyrant, 01101 putting 10 death a number 01 the

nobility, fell, assoon as he began to practise on the vulgar.

This'Satire was probably published not long after the death
01 Domitian, when its subject would still retain some degree

01 1101111011 and interest. Line 103 would seem to show that ’
ly( 'it was written before Hadrian rejintroduced the 0100110001
wearing a heard.
,

Crispinus is represented as still wealthy, and we may be· ·
liene, says hlacleane, that his wealth did not stay with him

long during the next reigns. But this by uo means neees-
sarily follows.
