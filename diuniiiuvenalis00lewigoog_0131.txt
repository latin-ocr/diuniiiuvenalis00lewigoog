¹mitian's turbot, aud ho may have thrown aside Crispinus, and
gone on to his new subject The former hypothesis 1 think
the more probable. This is perhaps a draft introduction to

an intended satire never eompleted. Plenty of similar ex· .

amples of “dore-tailing ” may be found in the moderas. The
vice of the commentatore is that they never apply the same
laws to the aucients as to the moderns; cn pn, had grammr
isto be found iu Addisou, but is never admitted in a classical
author, aud pagos of useless disquisitione are often written.

sarily mean, “whom 1 shall often have to summonte playhis

Delicias aidane . . . but ours is the reading of P. deliciae is
here “a mini0u;'’ cf. Mart. viii 48, Nan qaicnnrpnc capit
saturatas mircice creles Nec nisi deliciis convenit nn coloe, where
the term “ deliciae'’ is, by implicatiou, bestowed on this very
Crispinus, though in what precise sense is not clear. It does, ·
not seem impossible that Juvenal may lrave had this epigram
in his mind, when using the epithet. Cf. Quint, Iusti 2,
cerlo ne Alexandrinis qnidam pcrnn'llcado deliciis. deliciae, when
applied to a mnu, has almost always, in later writers, an in-
decent sense (Peteon. 68, hcl, Stat. Sila v 5, 67, and is so
defined by Plutarch, Anton. 59, 'Ode Σὰςμεπος ἦν τῶν Kalcagce'
ancyriae narddgeca, ἁ δηλίκια Ῥωμαῖοι καλοῦσι. So also delicalns
and delicato. ll'ith the other reading, Heinrich renders ,
delicias by “ amours '' and quotes Cic. pro Cael 19, Amores el
lece deliciae qaaecocanlnr. This may also be the meaning in
Catull. 6, F lari, delicias inas Catulla, n'r· sini illepidae alque in
elepantos, l'elles elicere nee facere posses, though 1 think the
sense there is “your sweet·lreart,'' aud dicere is “to name.'’'
An intrigue with a widow or· virgin would be properly
stuprum, not calidiomeam,- and the defeneeless position of a
· single woman would, iu the eyes of Crispinus, deprire such
an amour of all charms. Non ila nie Di anrenl, arrideret lraec
