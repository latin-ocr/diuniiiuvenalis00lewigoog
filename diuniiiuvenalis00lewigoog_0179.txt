82-113: A lively picture ol one oi these great adies,

wife ola senator, eloping with a common gladiator, and ·

making off, in his company, ιο Egypt . The name given to
this lady is Hippia, which occurs again at x 220, and tho
gladiator is called Sergius. These are leigned names, accords ’
ing ιο Heinrich, and are taken from Cicero, Philipp. ii 25.

Samio mimo tradere. But then, Velamima real and well-known,
and possibly living, character, iii 185, iv 113, is mentioned at
¹¹3 oi this Satire as the lady's husband. This, says Heinrich,
is alter Juvenal’s manner, “her Veiento, her husband, the
senator.'' This does not appear ιο mean altogether satisfac-
tory explanationes ‘⁴ Veiento.” The coincidence ol the other
two names with those in Cicero, is, however, carious It
had been noticed by others before Heinrich. In Plutarch's
“ Antony,” 9, Hippias appears as a otiatus, at whose marriage
Antony attends; Sergius as another miurus. It is not certain

real occurrence appears to be referred to. 83: samma

Whether Paris was alive at the time of this woman's ssight,
or whether the name is used generally lor the great actors oi
Rome, we do not know. The meaning is, she not only de·
serted her children, but-would you believe it l-the games
