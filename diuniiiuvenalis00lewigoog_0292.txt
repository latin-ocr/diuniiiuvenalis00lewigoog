SATIRE lx. 271

may have had Lucilius in his memory here, Aru'mo qui aeprotat,

uidemur corpore laurac siquam dare, Fr. xxvi 55. 21: pro·
positam, v 1. 22: nuper, as Maoleane observes, “does not
always mean that which was very lately, but in former years.
In Hor. Epod. 9 7, it means six years before.” Cf. deaii
29, and iv 9. In Cicero de Senect. Cato Major, speaking,
Rc. 150, mentions P. Crassum reaper, pontificem maximum, aa,
sixty·two years before. In the Div. in Q, Caco. 2ο, it is used
of a time some thirty years before, iu Son. de Ira ii 5, of an
erent which must have happened at least thirty to forty
years before. Cicero speaks of ea qaue areper, id cat paucio
arete aetalia, reperta sarit, Nat Deor. ii 50, but here he means
“ recently,” comparatively speaking, in reference to his subject;
as we might say, “Tho artos printing is a recent invention
in the history oi mankind.’' Ganymedea is usually taken for
a temple of Jupiter, where his statue would naturally be
‘ found, but I think that it should be taken with Pacis. The
i temple of Peace erectcd by Vespasian, after the termination

of the J ewish war, was adorned with many magnificent works

oi art, and there may have been a well-known statue of Gany-

mede among them. Certainly secreta palatiu does not apply
> well to Pax, whose rites uere not secret, aad whose templo
uas not (like that of Cybele) on the Palatine Hill. Moreover
all the other temples mentioned are those of female divinities,
Pac, Iria, Cybele, Cerea, the three last particularly frequented
bywomen. It uas to these that an adulterer, moechus, in'
search of bonnes-fortunes would go, and the temple of Jupiter
is out of place—for 26 is throun in parenthetically. 242„
Cererem, the temple of Cerae, a common usage: crate castorii,
ad Spei, &a quo . .· . templo, vi 489, and compare Propert
i'r1910‚ Foroque percutis plurimo cerreta iaie. The early
Christian writers continually assigu this character to the
temples. 25: celebrare, iii 249· 26: inclinare, 12224ο
as inclaruere, Mart. xi 43 5.

28: pirrpues lucernas. So Martial, Te Cadmea Tyros me ·

pinquis Gallia recht, vi rr, aud hc speaks of a cloak as atqua-
m'cae piaquem textricis ultraneum, iv 9. piuyafs there, as well

as here, means “course'' “thick'’ not grcasy. 31: hlacleane
