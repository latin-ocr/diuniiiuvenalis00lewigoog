161: dirus Hannibal is horrowed from Horace. Quintilian,
viii 2, appears to think the epithet so applied a somewhat
bold, but happy one; why, I do not know. It is here used
jocularly. 163: As to these storms which prevented
Hannibal from engaging the Roman army, see Livy xxvi 11.
The popular idea, embodied in the some historian, xxii 51,
that Hannibal aiter Cannae lost the decisive opportunity oi
marching upon Rome, is combated by Mommsen with con·
siderable plausibility: “He knew Rome better than the

disputations about ravishers and poisonings, and J asons, and t.

with all these difficulties) my advice to them would be to
throw up their profession altogether, and take to a different·
line, instead of going down to figh't in the courts (ad prayaom),
lest the value ol a ‘⁶ ticket sor corn '² should be thrown away.
They would get this as poor citizens, in any case; and a suc-
cessful verdict will bring in no more (or by being absent at
the court they might lose their coru-ticket). I cannot agree
with Macleaue “that they gire up tecching, and go and
