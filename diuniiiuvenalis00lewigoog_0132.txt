SATIRE f V. ιιι

He would not dare to act thus even towards an unprotected
woman. And cf. Petron 95. 4, 5: jactanto, which has
survived in the Freneh “jument‚'' applied exclusively to
mares, was more widely applied in Latin. At iii 316 317, it
means inules, as at vii 180 181, where, ae hore, they are
driven up and down in porticoes‚ which were covered walke
or colonnades attachedto the houses of the great. ὃς
vectetur, se, in his lectica orsella 7 : aedes (riciaco soro)-
What does it matter, how large are his investments in town
ι property l-which would, of course, be the most expensive
of all property to buy. 8, 9; corruptor . . . irroratos. A
ι man who adds ineest to seduction. It would be incest to lie
witha vestal virgin. Vestal ‚virgins who violated their vowe
of chastity were hurried alive. The male was scourged to
death. But, according to Suetonius the peccadilloes of
vestale were not very closely loohed after in the reigns of
Vespasian and Titus. Domitian re-iutroduced the old
severity on the suhject, and put a few of these women to
death. ll'e must suppose what is here related of Crispinus to
be true3 still, it is rather remarkable that so singular a fact
as a favourite of the Emperor sedueing a vestal, who was
buried alive, while he himself got off scot-free, should not be
mentioned elsewhere. Heinrich's idea that audiface here

means “at the risk of,” dcc, cannot be entertained. From¹ ’

what the poet says, it seems to have been notorious that
*Crispin had “ lately'’—under Domitian it is to he presumed-
lain with a vestal. lf so, she would have been put to death,
and it is safer to keep to the ordinary sense of the fut. par-
ticiple. 12: jadra mortar. Domitian is alluded to, who
assumed the censorship for life. For cederem, cf. vii 70,
note. 13: 'lilius {arrd Seius were the John Doe and
Richard Roe of Roman legal proceedings. So Cetius and Ceio
(in wedding ceremonias particularly), and we find Cetius Scias,
“John dones.'’ The sentiment here ma)v have hoen copied
by hlacaulay in one of his essars (who immediately before
quotes some lines from this Satine). “Thoricos of honest
meu are the virtues ofBarere.” And something not unhke
it is to he found in Cicero, iu Verrem, 5 44. 14: elitaret
secationi taho to be the sarae as dirior et foedior, see ii 122
