Perside in Romanum imperium.'’ This is not very satisfac·
toryto me. Others take it as “ tho J ewish gate through which
Vespasian and Titus entered the city in their triumph alter
their victorias in Palestine.’' But there is no authority for the
existence of any gnte so called; and why, if there were sucha

lords'' him. Cum te non nossem, dominam reponique amabam,
Mart. i 113, iv 84 5, ancl xii 60 14. dominas was acommon
appellative in the time of Juvenal. 162: Cyane, “the

taken here to be the same as thermopolim, “places where
hot drinks were sold.'' But this is quite conjectural. In our
uncertainty as to the exact meaning of the words, Ι prefer to
take thermae in its nsual sense, and to render “the drinking
orgies ol the bath.'' That drinking did go on at the public ·
baths is shown by Mart, xli 70, Satrius a thermis nescit ahira
domurn, and the whole epigram; and in Petron. 28 (to which,
however, too much importance must not be attached), we read
how, while Trimalchio was being rubbed dry, tres iatraliptae
in conspecta ejus Falernum potabant. Compare Pera. iii 100.
In Senee. Epp. 56, we have, at the baths, peoplc selling cakes
and pastry, et onrrecs popinarum institores mercem sno quodam et

the practice of drinking at tho baths distinctly mentioned, in
