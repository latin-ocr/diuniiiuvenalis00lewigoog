96: sqq. The poet introduces the J ews; see vi 159 160,
where the Sabbatlrs and the pigs have already ligured. When
he speaks of people turning Jews, through parental example,I
cannot but think that he coniounds Christiane with Jews, as his
countryrnen were wont to do. 'l'lre former, who were making
many proselytes at this time, were supposed to be a sect of the
latter, and even il the hatred which the Jews bore to theChris·
tiens were generally noticed, it would prore no bar to this idea
being held3 on the contrary, it would serre to conlirm it, as
the hatred existing between religione anderen philosophieal
secta was known, thenas now, often to spring from very
minute differentes. cf. Sueton. Tiber. 36, where the expres-
sion similia (Judaeis) sectantes has been held to refer to Chris-
tians, though it is not likely that many had penetrated to
Rome, ,al tlrnt early period. (ἔτ’. Tac. Ann. ii 85. Sueten.
Domit. 12, qni vel inrprqtessi Jrutuicum eiecerat citam eet, dia·
simututu origine, tributu eron pependissent, may not improbably
have reference to Olrristians, and Jewish converts to Chris-
tianity 3 aud another passage, in the same author, Claud. 25,
Judueor, impulsore Christo, essetne tumultuantes, ilonea expulit,
shows tlre confused notion then entertained as to the two
religione. Similarly Dion tells us that besides Jews proper,
others bear the name who τά νόμιμα αὐτῶν, καίπερ dannetur}
ὄντες ζηλοῦσι, xxxvii 173 and iu lxvii 14, he speaks of people
being condemned, including Flavius Clemens, under Domitian,
lor going over to tlredews, Compare also lxviii 1. In all ’
these cases, he probably refers to Christiane, and many other
examples might be given of this confusion on the part of
pagan writers, during the first two centuries, en pn, Arrlan
tii 9), quoted by Lipsius on Tac. Ann. xv 44, who wrote not
much later than J uvenal. Sahhatlrs were spoken ol in Satine
vi, loc. cit, as sesto. Augustus, in Suetonius, Aug. 76, seems
to look upon them as fasts, which they were not, Ne Judaeus
quidem, eni Tiberi, tam diligenter sabbatis jejunium serrant, perans
epo hodie serensi. Probably all that Augustus and Juvenal
knew oi tho matter was that the seventh day was, in some
way or other, held sacred hythe terr-s. 96: nretuerc aud
