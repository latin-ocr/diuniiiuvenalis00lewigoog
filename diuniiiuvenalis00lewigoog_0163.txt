Heinrich, following some ol the older commentatore, takes
homuncio as a nominative, “some god-like little man,'’ as
opposed to Deus, and sees an allusion to Ter. Eun. iiis 42.
A: quem Derim? . . . eqo humuncio hoc uoufceeriml Others,
as Ruperti, take it as a vocative. 1f that be so, there is,
perhaps, an allusion to Eur. Cy. 316. ὄςλοῦτος, dulgoelm, τοῖς
σοφοῖς luta hauruneia, “my little man,'' used playfully, is not
at all uncommon, ea qr, Quin lu quicumque ee, homuncio
lueeranm, ait, uetulum milui erpcdisl Appuh Met. ix 181.
This, like many other passages ia Juvenal, is nota ease for
dogmatising, as Macleane does. “It ie the nominative,” he
says Heraeum, an editor is expected to urrive at u conclu·
sion, and cannot abendon a passage with the old formula,
“Judieel leetac.” Ι hare given the former rendering, asbeing
the one which certainly gives more life to the passage. The
Gods and the Fates are coupled together in this way, audieus

viii 81 6. “ Caius aad bank-notes, you are really his brothers,
not the man who owns them,'’ as rre should say. Dominus
may be either the “ Lord of your Lord,'' or “aLord your-
seli.” Ι prefer the former. 138, 139; Another allusion
to Virgil, Si quis milui paruulus aula Luderel Aeneas, Aen. ir

says, Functus csl optimi ciris officio, quod scurrilitate aroris lurqe
