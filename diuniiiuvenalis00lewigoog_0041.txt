20 INTRODUCTION.

tion, Lord Lytton has written a very clever satire on

living rnen called “ St. Stephens','' imm which posterity , .

might learna good deal, and he has also plunged into
mythology and epic poetry in the shupe of “King

Arthur,” from which posterity can leam nothing, oi our . ’

giving an opinion on their respective menits, Ῑ think .
that the future critic might find it a hard matter to dis·
cover the same hand in both oi them3 or, rather, by
following the method we are considering, he would find
it an easy matter to show that they were the work oi
different hands. ⁸
In the next place, il these so-called spurious satires be
imitatione, they are very singular ones, lor they fail to
imitate. (I except the prologues to Satires IV. and ΧΙ.,
which I can just conceive it possibleoza'ybt have been put

passages in XI.) Whether the “poet of low order”
confrned his imitation to one or two exceptional passages

when the occasion scemed to require, in a burst of decla·
motion like the thirty-eight lines in satire VIII, might
not have similarly produced, when treating ol congenial
themes, the declamatione known as Satires X.‚X111.,
XIV, «bc, is the point for consideration. To me the latter
alternative is iurmensely the more probable of the two.
If conjecture were of the slightest avail, I should conjec
