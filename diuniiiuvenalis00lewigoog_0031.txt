ro · INTRODUCTION.

deal of comment has been made upon this epigram, and
the word inquietae has been held to imply that he was “ in
pressy circumstances.” Το me, it conveys rather that
uncasy and suspicions character which his writings would
show him to have been possessed of, and about which his
friend Martial gently rallies him. After all, the epigram
amounts to little more than this, expressed iu prose—
“While you, perhaps, cre engaged in the worrying pur-
· suits of the town, I arn enjoying the ease of the country.'’
- All, then, that can be guthered with certainty from
external sources is, that there was a Juvenal (in all
probability the poet), the friend of Martial, end who was
residing in Rome in the year 93, and some time between,
100 and 104.

We are now forced to turn to the only source from
which we shall derive the slightest profit, the Satires
themselves .

Juvenal was most certainly alive after Domitian had
perished in an. 96, for he speaks oi the death of that
Emperor, iv. 1533 and after the conviction of Morbis
Priscus, which we know to have taken place in nn. 100
-cyffn 47. There is no reliable evidence that he sur-
vived the latter date by many years, but there is some
reason to suppose that he was writing as late as ab. 119
-xiii 17, xv. 27. ·The second satire seems to have
been written during the reign of Domitian, ii. 160, aa,
and the fourth not long after his assassination. It has
been inferred from xiv. 90, and vi. 502, 5 5 5, that those
two satires cannot have been written later than in
Hadrian's reign, while xii line 75 could not have been
written before Trajan's time. There are other passages

noticed in the notes, bnt the conclusions to which they Ι

point are all similar. Juvenal may be described as a
poet who lived towards the end ο1 the first and the
beginning of the second century after Christ, the con-
temporary of Qintilian, Statius hlartial Silius, Valerius
