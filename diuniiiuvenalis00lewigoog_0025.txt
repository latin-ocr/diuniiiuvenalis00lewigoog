4 INTRODUCTION.

modico quidem auditorio quiequam committere est ausus, mox
magna frequentia tantoque successu bis¹ aut ter auditus est, ut
ea quoque quae primafecerat inferciret noris scriptis ε “ quod non
dant proceres dabit histria, tu Camerinos et Bareas, tu nobilium
magna atria eurasl praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos.''
erat tunc in deliciis aulae histrio* multique fautorum ejus quot-
tidie provehebantur. venit ergo J uvenalis in suspicionem quasi

tempora† figurat notasset, ac statim per honorem militiae ,

quamquam octogenarius urbe summotus est missusque ad
praefecturam cohortis in extrema parto Aegypti tendentia id
supplicii genus placuit ut levi atque joculari delicto par esset.
verum intra brevissimum tempus angore ac taedio periit.

J unius J uvenalis, the senor the adopted son, it is uncertain
which, 01 a wealthy freedman, praetised declamation till about
middle life, rather for amusement's§ sake than in order to pre·
para himself for school or forum 3 and afterwards having
composcd a elever satire 11 of afew lines on Paris the actor in
pantomimos, and a poet [of his] who was puffed up with his
six months’ military rank, he cultivated diligently this kind oi
writing. And yet, fora very long time, he did not venture to
intrust anything even to asnrall audience. But after arvhile
he was heard two or three times by so largea concourse, and
withso much success, that he inserted in his neu writings the
lines he had first composcd, “Quod non dant proceres dabit
lristrio,'' &c Tho actor [or an actorlil uas ot that time one
01 the court minions, and nrany of lais supporters uero daily
receiving promotion. ,duvenal consequently incurred the sus·
pieion 01 indirectlyll censuring the [existiug] times, ond
scarheim, under the guiso of military pronrotion, though he
was eighty years of age, uas removed from the city, and sent
to be praefert 01 a cohart which uas quartered at the extremity
01 Egypt. This kind of punishment vvas decided upon, as being
adopted to a light and jocular kind 01 offence. Hoiverer, in
the course of a very short time, he died of vexation and ennui.

⁴⁵ laestrio, omitted. † praeseutia. ζ figurate forfiyura.

5 enimi, “inclination.” 11 aon absurde, “utterly” in Sueten. Dom. 3.

11 11 histrio be omitted, we shall bavato understand the meaning to be ·
that he (Paris) was among the court favourites; or that some one was
among the court favourites; or we must suppose some w'ord other than
histrio to have dropped out. '

⁴* figura, “anallrrsiou.’' It is so used by Sueten. in Dom. 10. Spartan.
Severus 14 aad elsewhere. figurate, ‘⁴ figuratirely,” which would mean the
same thing.
