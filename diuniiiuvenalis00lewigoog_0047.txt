NOTES TO sntlun Ι.

1: The Roman authors, and more particularly tho poete,
were in the habit of reciting their new productione, sometimes .
in private, and then not unt'requently at dinncr-parties, Mart. .
iii 45, xi 5²3 at other times, in temples and other public
places, Hor. Sat. i 10 383 or in houses hired or lent by rich
patrous for the purpose, J uv. vii 403 the day being fixed in
advance, Juv. vii 83 84 ; aud circulor letters oi invitation
being sent out, Plin. Epp. iii 18. These recitatione wore
generally held previous to publication, Plin. Epp. ii ro v 3 v

younger Pliny greatly apyuoves ol the practice, and speaks in
Epp. i 13 of the town being full ol poets, and scarcely a day ¹
in oue whole month passing without recitations. Our tastes,

younger says ofonc of these recitaturis, Possunt jem repetere
secessum et scribere calipteni praeci reon recitem, ne ridear, qnorum

“though'’ licinus larentiies rupere et coacciderc loris Ererntu

solet, vi 414 415, “though entreated.” Phaedrus speaks of
molesti pectere, and Ouid of crannus poeto, in reference to this
practice ol rcciting, which, Ibelicve, still lingcrs in Italy.
