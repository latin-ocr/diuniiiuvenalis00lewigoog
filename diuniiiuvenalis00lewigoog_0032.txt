INTRODUCTION. 11

&saumana-aemma mny. We
have 'seen that he is styled facundus in anffi‘b'y a poet
who was intimate with him, and who nas himself born
in an? 43, and we have traces of him writing after
an. 119. It may then fairly be conjectured that he was

’ born abeat hu. 50, and that he died some time about
an„ 120.li And no nearer approximation than this can
be made to his epooh.

He seems to have received a liberal education, i. 15 ;
to have been in 'easy circumstances, at any rate at one
period oi his life, ui.; and to have had a property near
Tibur, xi. 65. He was, for some reason or other, attached
to Aquinum, an important town in Latium, where he was

· in the habit of going for change of air from Rome; it
may have been his hirthplaee, iii. 319. He was certainly
not born of a noble family, but in the ranlrs oi the people,
viii. 44, dac. The greater number oi his Satires appear

sto have been written in Rome, of which city it is prob·
able that he was a permanent inhabitant, iii. 319 above;
though he may at some time of his lise have been in
Egypt, xv. 453 and there are several passages in the
Satires which, in conjunction with the whole of xii, would
render it not improbable that he had made a long voyage
by sea, ior which alemant he had all a Roman's horror.
(Compare some touehes in Hippia’s voyage, vi. 90 sqq,
xiv. 272 sqq.) lt may be interred from what he says,

xi 201-20 3, that he attained to old age.
> His writingS, if they are to be talren as the real ex·
’ pression oi his leelings, exhibit him to us as a patriot of
l arather narrow type, iii. 84, 85, w'. 294 sqq, witha

⁴⁹ of course, I mean, us iar as the evidence from his writings goes. li
the “ Life '' be accepted, we shall have hirn born adorat an. 43 (ol the same
age as Martiali, beginning to try his hand at satiro about an. 83 (evidently
not iar from the date oi the second satire, and about the time oi Paris's
great popularityl‚ and banished about nn. 123. There is nothing very
improbable in these dates, which do not differ rnaterially irom those given
inthe text.
