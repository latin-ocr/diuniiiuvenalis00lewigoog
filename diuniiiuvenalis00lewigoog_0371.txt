nisceuce ol Seu. de lra. iii 26. 172: assidue, “ continually.’'
Olten as these sights occur, no one laughs. Heinrich renders
’ “attentively.” This illustratiou is not very happily iutro·
duced. In the country ol the pigmies, certainly no one who
looked ou ut their combats with tho craues (and who could
look ou except pigmies l) would be likely to laugh3 but this
would be not on account ol the commonucss oi the sight, but
oiitsperil. ¹

176, 177: nostro occari arbitrio is “to be put to death in ,

any way we choose.'' Thraseae Soranoque ct Serviliae datur
morliamdilricm, are allowed to choose their own modo of death,
Tac. Anu. xvi 333 Suetou. Domit. 8. 178-180: Some
take from sed to ipso as the speech ol the objector. The sense
will then be, “But the slightest quantity ol blood will afford
au cnviable consolation.'' In that case, it is said that ot
should be ct; but the reol objectiou is that the sense is far
inferior. 181: indoctus, as Macleane observes, is com-
monly used ol those who have not been made acquaiuted with
the doctrines ol the philosophers. It is so used at ii 4, and
perhaps at iii 87, but not at viii 49. Generally, it implies
ovant ol skill iu any particular art, Virg. Ecl. iii 26, Coningt.
184‚185: Great philosophers like Chrysippus or Thales or
Socrates wou't soy so. 189: sqq. quippe minuti, dra·
The contemptior women, real or affected, 'oi the author
which forms the hey-note ol the sixth satire, breaks out here.
193-195: quos diri conscio sacti. . . fluycllam. This is cer·
tainly a reminiscente of Lucretius. ol mens sibi conscia jactis
Procmctucas adhibet stimulos terretque floccidis, iii 1018 1019.
Ov. Met. viii 5 30 has almost the same words. 194: surdo,
“uoiseless,'’ ‘⁶ mute,” as at vii 71· surdus, however, like the
French “sourd,'' its derivative, sometimes hasa meaning

which is not exactly “uoiseless,'' or “dumo” The French ⁹
say “uu bruit sourd‚’' a dull uoise. 196: Poeno aulem
uehemens, without a verb. This is very much in the same
style as Poeno uatem praesens cum lu deponis amictus, in Satira 1.
dumque ardens sanquine, xi. 197 : Caedicius, 0 crnel courtier ,
ol Nero, according to the scholiast As Heinrich remarks,
this *might have been gothered from the text, and the same

observation will apply, os wc have already noticed, to many
