INTRODUCTION ΤΟ SATlRE XIV. 353

semel Moneyisthe grand thing! He theugoeson‚iuhisusual
style, to contrast all these great possessione with the simpli·
city aud frugality of the ancient inhabitants ol Italy. Luxury
has brought all these evils trpon us. Parents and narses are
always instilling tho main chance into their charge's minds as
theone greatrule of life. Dou't be afraid l Your son will as:
suredly better your instructions. lle will commit all sorts of
crimes which you may say that you never had in view, but of
which you are assurodly the prime cause. Perhaps some day
be may come to think that you yoursclf arc living rather too
longl

It ia better thau a play to watch the ways in which these
people get money. The poet then describes the perils ol the
deep.(of which he always seems to have a very vivid sense),
which are voluntarily run by merchauts in questos wealth.
To think of them being tossed about by the waves is as good
as to watch an screbat, ora tightropo duncer. Some day the
ship goes to pisces, and theu our poor friend, hali naked aud
starving‚ has to beg his broad. Thon what terrible cares does
the guardiauship of great wealth involvel What a dreadful
fright the millionaire is in lest a fire should consume his house
aud treasures of art! Diogenes in his tub had no such appre-
hensious. He was far happier thau Alexander piniug for a
whole world All that is really requisite is what may be
enough to sustamhledccently. If that rule seems too rigid
sor our manners, 1 give you a knight's or even a senator-'s loe.
If that won²t satisly you, nothing in the world will.

Maciesue well remarks upon 90 (see 90 note), that the palace
ol Hadrian could hardly have been built when J uvenal wrote
this Satire. Tire date of this construction is uncertain, butio
could scarcely have beon later than al). 134 Some sec iu
196 an allusion to Hadriau’s visit to Britain, nn. rao-121,
but this kind of conjecture is worthless. It might as well be
said that 99 isan allusion to the order against circumcisiou
issued by that Emperor, which uuis one ol the causes ol the
‹lewish war which broke out in his reign.
