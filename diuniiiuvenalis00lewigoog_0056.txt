SATIRE l. 33

have had one ring lor summer and another for winter.

30, 31 : iniquae urbia literally “ the nnjust, unsair city ; ”
hence it means the inequalities‚ the unfair contrasts offered
, by the city, such as those shown below—the small lawyer
turned grandee, the informer at the topos the trec, the
nobility in mins, &a ; so iniquas Caesaris od mensor, v 4, and
cf. xiv 126. 31 : ferrens, “ case-hardened,''as ue say. 32:
Matho aas ablustering advocato, osten laughed at by Juvenal
and Martial. At vii 1²9? he is represented¹ as abanhupt, end
it has been conjectured from this that, having failed as a
lawyer, he afterwards set up as an informer, aud made a
fortune 3 from vvhich it has been further inferred‚ that this
Satire, oret any rate this portion of it, is of later composition
than the seventh. But all this is without narrant. llere, at
any rate, :ve find him in his new palanquin, like a great man,
and furnishing one os those sights which, the poet says, might

rnuch as if it had boen originally written in the time of
Domitian. It is better to take it of the persons, not their
property. Compare iii 259, Quid superest dc corporibus? ef. also

iv 97. Bnt it might also mean, “ vrho will soon clutch from ,
the nobility u'lrat remains to them‚’' for rupee aliquid de alr'pno
is perfectly good. In either ease this seems an odd n'ay of
putting it, ‘⁴ what tenuatus ol what is arten ψ’ 35: MUSSCb.

younger uas assigned by the Senute as one oi the prosecuting
counsel against him, sor his extortions in the province oi
Baetica, Plin. Epp. vii 33. 36: Carus, another informer,
mentioned by Martial xii 25. Ecce reum Corus lc detulit, and
Plin. Epp. i 5, also in Epp. vii 27, nhere ho says that, if
Domitian had liveda little longer, he should have perished,
