and the delicate banter of Horace, of which no example
existed previous to his time in Roman literature, while
medem literature fumishes much that is akin to it,
though not distinctly imitated from it. There are many
ancient writers, with regard to whom itis necessary.for
us to make a considerable mental ehhrt, in order to throw
ourselvcs back into the times in which they wrote, and
to conceive the tone oi thought which prevailed in their
day. Juvenal, when the difficulties of another kind which
mark his writings are surmounted, requires no such effert.
In his way of looking at things, and especially the
grotesque side of things, in his word-pointing, in his
illustrations, he is essentially a man of the present day.
Accordingly he has often been imitated—by Boileau
and Johnson for instance—while such writers as Aris·
tophanes and Plautus nro incapablc of being modernised
with any degree of success

A short but important work on Juvenal has recently
been published in Germany. It would he impossible
for mein my limits to notice it adequately, but Ι can-
not ret'rain srom alluding to it. This is “Der echte und
der unechte Juvenal ’' (the genuine and spurious Juvenal),
hy Ribbeck, who has edited our author. Vicwed as a
criticism of some portion of the poct's work, I think it
valuablc, though it is distigured hy grass exaggeratione,
and by a manifest straining in favour of a soregone con-
clpsion, which, to my mind, Ribbeck altogether fails to
establish.

The conclusion is this: that a considerable portion of
what we accept as J uvenal’s Satires is spurious. Accord-
ing to Ribbeck, the genuino ones are the first, second,
third, fourth (with the exceptiones 1-36)‚ fifth, sixth‚
seventh, cighth‚ ninth, eleventh (with the exceptiones
1- 5 5), and possibly the sixteenth. The supposititious ones
arethe tenth, twclsth, thirteenth, sourtcenth, fifteenth, to

which must be added tho introductions to Satires lV. and
von 11. n
