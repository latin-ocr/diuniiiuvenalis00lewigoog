SATIRE VIII. 263

bishy poenis like the Troica, iii 9, note. If we are ιο believe
Lucian, the Emperor put to death, at the Isthmion gemes, a
singer whose voice drowned his own. 221: quid noim
Verginius onmia, hc. “ He aslrs which of all Nero’s crimes se ·
called for punishment, 'as his having written this dull poem,''
Macleane. Ican scarcely think that Juvenal meant ιο say
this. The humour of what has preceded, Troico non scripsit,
coming after a catalogue of crimes, would be destroyed by
dwelling on the idea If Nero had never done worse, he
would have been simply ridiculous. The poet has, rather,
the whole career of Nero before his eyes, and particularly his
public appearances on the stage, which he is just going to
mention. “What could Verginius, dvc, have found (in the

world) more deserving of the vengeanee of their armiesl
What did Nero dein all his tyrannyl This is what he did,”

, dc. 221, 222: Verginius, Vindex, Gallo. The last named

was Nero’s successor. Vindex commanded in Gaul, and first
raised the standard of Galba, but Verginius marched against
him, protesting that he would acknowledge no one es Em·

perer till he had been proclaimed by the Senate. Verginius,
however, subsequently aided in the establishnient of Galba.
Verginius Rufus was a very remarkable figure in the history
of these times, a man who had several times refused the irn-
perinl throne. He had not long been dead when this Satire
was written, and he was honoured with a public funeral, Plin.
Epp. ii 1. It is rather strange to find Juvenal coupling him

with Vindex, ns the epitaph composed by himself for his
tomb ran thus, Hie silus est Rosos palso qui Vindice quondam
Imperium asseruit reon sili sed patriae, Plin. Epp. vi 10. The
poet, however, cites these three men as having been the most
instrumental in the downfall of Nero. 224-226: How
Nero went about Greece performing in public is related by
Suetonius, Ner, and others. apion, “parsley'' was used by
the ancients sor crowning the head, Floribus atque opio critas
ornatus orioro, Virg. Ecl. 6 685 ἑ-,τί δ’ ὀφρύων arinen cracante-

Nero, Romam introiti coronant capilo percos Olympiacam dextro
