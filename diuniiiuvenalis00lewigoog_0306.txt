among other passages, quotes Tae. Ann. vi 35. But why not
quote the same author, Hist. i 44 and iii 27, in both of which
matus is applied to the Roman pilrel Really this is criticism
run mad. 22 ε Compare Sen. Epp. 14, ardum latro troas-
mittit, etiam ia clausaria pauperi pat est. ovid had said the samo
thing before, in lines which were probably in our author's
memory, Sic timet insidiae, pai seit-se ferre eiator· Oai timeat,·

Wealthy rnen, it would seem, lodged their strong-boxes in
the Forum, probably with the arperrtarii who carried on busi-
ness there. The rernains ol ulrat are supposed to have been
their offiees, tabernac (seren in number), are still to be seen in
the forum at Pompeii. Compare xiv 259, sqq. 26: Ficti-

from the other. porreta pererrata, v 43. What has preceded
is, in agreat measure, an amplificationes Seneca, Oct. 895,

of the wine, not its spirit. lt certainly refers to its strength
in this passage of Horace, and, Ι think, it does here. Com·

sopher. auctor is preferable to atter, another reading which
is very tame. Seneca has two passages in which these two
philosophare are introduced, de Ira. ii 10, and de Tr. An. 15,
which our author may have had in view, though Seneca there
is merely giving the popular tradition, as duvenal here.
