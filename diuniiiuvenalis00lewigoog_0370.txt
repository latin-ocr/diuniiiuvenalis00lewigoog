SATIRE XIII. 347

145: Ine suls. eoept. ξίφη rt κὰι cruram troie teter εἰς τὴν
Κεθήγου φέροντες otetur, Plut Cic. 146 : prinam erem jonae ·
cottipr't tyna. Compare lx 98, medelam opponere taleis.
148: robigo seems to be rust, as applied to any metal. scr·
meyo is properly the rust of iron, and certeco, of brass Pliny,
H. N, applies robiyo to both, ces ec serrum rott'yo corripit, and
in another passage to gold 3 see Torcellini. Horace applies
it to corn, apparently in the sense of bliglrt or mildew, acc
pestilentem sentiet Α feteam F ecardo m'tis aee steritem sepes Rota-
yt'rtem, Od. iii 2 3 5 7, and so l'irgil and Ovid. We speah of
corn rustiug. 150: minor, “ready to commit sacrilege on
a smaller scale,'' “ready to turn a dishonest penny in any
way.'' The man who before now has melted down a full-
length statue of Jupiter, won’t hesitate, if there is nothing
better to be douo iu his line, to serape the gold off the thIghs
of a Neptune, &a (ln the next satire, 261, we hear of the ·
helmet of Mars being stolen.) This is the only way in which
we can give a clear sense to this passage, but even thus ia
must be coufessed that 153 does not come iu very well. It ,
would be better away. 154: mercatorem, “the purchaser‚”
xiv 143. ¹ 155: deducendama metaphor from a ship. cf.
viri 213, note. 157: pactapact, scelerum. Et quoto pers
istu scelerum est? Seu. de Ir. ii 8. quota portio faecis Acltcet't
Jur. iii or. Rutilius Gallicus was praefectus urbi, iv ῃ, under
DomitIam and possibly nuder Vespasian, and the friend of
Statius, the poet, Silv. i 4. Either, therefore, the first dral't
of this Satine dates from Vespasian, 17 note, or²Gallieus is
used for the prefect of the day ; why, it is difficolt to say, for
Gallicus was not a well-known man. The praejectus arbi,
after the time of Angustus, was a sort of magistrate, and
chief of the police with very extended powers, cf. Dict. G.
and R. Ant. 162: gottre is still common in the Alps,
Quis tumidum yattrtr mt'rotar t'a Alpibus? is very much iu the
style of Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes? at ii 24·
164‚165: blartial has an epigram on the fleca caesaries of
the northern natione. Α retoa de yeate comam titt Lesbio misi,
Ut scires quanto eit tussiaco acopis, v 68. Tacitus speaks of the

Germans’ traces et coerulei oculi. The swelled breasts of Meroe ¹

are otherwise unknown to us. This passage seems a remi· ·
