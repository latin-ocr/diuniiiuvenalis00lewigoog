Tun poet aslrs of what nse are Iofty pedi crees and family l
imag es to a man who shows himself unworthyf o fhis great
ancestors. Virtue1s the only nohility Disting uish onurself
by your character, and I am ready to acknovvledg ro the noble· y
man. There rs not thing c1n a great name.

It1s all very vvell 101 some people to boast of their high
connect ions, and to sneer at us, and sit ethome and donothIng,
vvh'ile men 01 Iovv origIn are actIver engaged in serving 'the .
State. Say, vvith regard to dumb animale, hovv do vve judge ¹
themt We value the horse for Iris fleetness and the victories ²,
Ire has won, not for his pedigree. So, then, let these people ἶ
go and do something on their ovvn account before claiming ¹
our homage. '

Do not lean therefore on the reputation of your ancestors‚
Ponticus. Be, yonrself, upright in the discharge of a citinen's
ordinary duties If you become governor of a province, bo
distinguished for your cIemency and justice, aud avoid the
plundering habits 01 some of our governors.

Some oi these people, for all their nobiIit,y turn amateur
coachmen, and frequent Iovv haunts by nro cht, and do things
vvhich,1n tho case 01 aslave, would ensnrc his being asena to
the bridewell. Others, vhcn they are ruined, take to tho
stage; others to the arena. A noble spectaole 1·

Who would not prefer Seneca to Nero—a monster stained
with every crimel Look at Catilina and Cethegus, men of
lofty birth! Who saved the State from theIr vile machina·
tlonsl The upstart Cicero. Look at the plebeian Decii, and
the ploughman illarius, and the slave who revealed tho con·
spiracy of the consul's own sons. Botter be an Achilles, tho I
son of a Thersites, than aThersites the son 01 an Achilles. ⁴
