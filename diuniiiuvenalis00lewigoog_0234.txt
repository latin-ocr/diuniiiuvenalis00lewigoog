INTRODUCTION TO SATIRE Vll. 213

owe their success to a rare good fortune: the majority come
off badly, and their pupils look down upon them.
Teachers oi grammar are in a like case. They aro robbed

oi part of their sees by the servants; they have to get up in
the small hours; the parents oi their charges expect that they
should be gifted with universal knowledge, that they should
bc ansverable lor the morals oi their pupils; and then pay
them, for a year's work, as much as a popular favourite geta
for a single victory in the Circus or Amphitheatre!

The date of this Satira depende on an answer to the ques·
tion, Who is the emperor alluded to in the iirst linet Ι think
Hadrian is most likely to he the man. Itis impossible to
suppose, with Gifford, that Domitian is meant; ior Paris, the
actor, 87, sqq„ had not obtained a great reputation till some
time aiter Domitiau’s accession, when that Emperor had begun
to develop qualities which rendered him an object oi abhor-
rence to the Satirist. And while Juvenal constaptly uses
the names of dead men, i 170 171, in a typical sense (as, for
instance, Lucan and Palaemon in this very Satira, 79 215), he
had nottho gift oi prophecy. Whatl have just said about
Lucan, luc, may npply to Statius and Paris3 the names may
be used as types. When he tells us that Paris patronises
poets, it seems to me probable that he is satirising, under
that name, afavourite of Hadrian, unknown to ns, and some
living poet might be designated by Statius, which would be
quite in Juvenal’s manner, or, 82-87 refer to a real occur·
rence in the life of Statius (dead before this was written),
and 88-92 beginning with ille et, “ Aye and Paris too,” are a
hit at a contemporary actor, possibly oi the same name* The
mention oi Quintilian's wealth, or supposed wealth, must also
refer to a later time than the opening year os Domitian'sreign.

⁴* cf. Introd. p 209 note. That the name ol a favourite abtor was‘
constantly assumed by other actors after him, is certain irom other exemplos
besides thisoi Paris ; asyntheta were at least three artistes who bore the
name oi Pylades; one in the reign of Augustus, Suet. Aug. 45, another a
iavourite oi Trajan, Dio. lxviii ιο, a third mentioned in an inscription ol
Gruter, ci. F ronto. Epp. ad Ver. 8 Aug. Mais' note. But it is not neces-
sary to suppose that the person aimed at should have been called Paris. Ι
