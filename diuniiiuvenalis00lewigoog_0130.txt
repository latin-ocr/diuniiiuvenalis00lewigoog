NOTES ΤΟ SATIRE IV.

1-3e: There is a difficulty about this introductory part of
the Satire, and some critias, euch as Ribbeck, pronounce it
spurious. This difficulty cannot be stated better than iu the
words of Mc Long. “The first thirty-six linea have no con·
nection with the real subject of the Satire. The beginning
, ol the prologue announces that Crispinus is again brought on
the stage, and the writer declares his intention to summan

him often to play his part. We expect that we are going to .

read a terrible invective against the fellovv3 but aiter a few
general remarks about his villnny‚ ive arc told that the present
Satire will only treat of his smaller offences 3 and then comes
the particular charge against him ol buying a fish at an enor-
mous price, and eating it himself. The mention os the fish is

supposed to be a elever way of connecting the introduction ,

trith the real Satine, the subject of which is the great fish that
vas presented to Domitian. But v'hat becomes of Crispinus
alter this flourisht He plays a most insignificant part in the
scene before the Emperor, aud says not a word about the big
fish, though something would have been very much to the
purpose from a man who was a buyer of lish, and in bis early
days cried them through the streete ol Rome.”

All this is true, and the first fifty-five lines ol the eleveuth
Satira offer similar difficulties Yet I am inclined to think
that both these passages are Juvenal’s work. They may have
been written by him at a different time from the rest of the
tivo satires, arrd subsequently fitted in by him to the places
which they now respectively oecupy, in accordancc with a
practice of his, ol which I think several traces may be pcr-
ceived, and which is distinctly referred to by the voice of
the very old tradition ulrich speahs in the supposed Life of
. Suetonius. Moreover Jiiverral is exceedingly discursive. The
mentiones the mullet at 15 may have suggested to him Do·
