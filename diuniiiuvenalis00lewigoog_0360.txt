NOTES TO SATIRE XIII.

1: exemplo molo, “so as to bea bad pattern ¹for imita·
¹ tion.'' Heinrich readers “malo modo, malc.’' exemplant is
not uncommon in this sense. Si ictoceccaano Iu omnibus pai
quoerant respondebas, Plaut. Asin. ii 3 9, sc. isto modo ,· and
often in Plautus, aud elsewhere. But hcre something moro
is conveyed, as iu Phaedr. i 26, sco qumque crompIo debet
aeq-uo ocimo poli, “treatment of which he has himself set the
example.'' ipsi dispIc'ocI auctori. Compare Seu. Epp. 42, nco
allo major poeno aequilioc est crtum qood siti oc scis displicet.
4: Praetoris arco, either tho urn from which thc names of
the judices were taken, or that in which they deposited tho
tablets containing their verdicts. We cannot tell how far tho
praetor, who presided in crimiual cases, may have had special
opportunities for tampering with one of those urus nrore
, than the other. He may have been able to “ pack ajury,'’ as we
term it; or at the close ol the trial-iu which the judices
pronouuced on the guilt or iunocence of tho prisoner, by a
majority-he may have giren out a salse return oI tlichallot,
though we can scarcely suppose the latter proceedIng to haro
been easy or common. ln either case the meaning is, “ Though
the guilty man may be acquitted in a court os law by corrupt
influeuce, heis not acquitted by his own conscience.” 5:
sqq. The sense is, “ Don't you lrnow that all your Iric‘nds
. sympathise with youl And, morcovcr‚ you can afford tho
loss.'' oriculae is translated by hir. Evans, “ the charge yon
bring.'’ It is better to rcndcr “ crinre‚” as at 24, below. 8·
jactam, iii 125, note. The introduction of the word here
certainly produces a very confused metaphor, as Ribbeck
dces not fail to notice. ¹

14, 15: spumantibus ardens visceribus, So i 45, siccum
jecur ardeat iro,· aud vi 648, rabie jecur recendente. Seneca
