Drusus, in moral character 1 ” There is an emphasis here on
moribus, A Paulus and Cossus are mentioned together in vii

been a Drusus 01 the same stamp; and the meaning might
he, “ be a Paulus, 100, 111 something more than mere name.’'
These 010 names 01 the Aemilian, 0010011011, and Livian
gentes. What are the. particular members of these families
whom the poet holds up as examples, is a matter 01 doubt. ·
He may have used the words generally 10111011 01 1110 old
stamp. The two most distinguished 01 tbe Pauli vvere the
consul who perished at Cannae, animaeque nruynac Prodigum
Paulum superante Poeno, Hor. 011. i 12 ; ancl his son. Juvenal
had probably both 01 these in his mind. Drusus may mean
Drusus the younger, brother 01 Tiberius, and father 011101-

is probably alluded to by the poet. 27 ι Silanus, the name
01 several noble Roman families. It is evidently used here
in 0 general sense. The Junii Silani are most probably
glanced at, as they vvere connected with the Caesars by mar-
riage, au'd might be proud 01 that circumstance, 72. 29,

This is explained by Plin. H. N. viii 46. The superstitious
Egyptians, for whom Juvenal lrad an especial contempt, svor-
shipped their god 011110, under the form 01 0 live bull. When
the animal grew old, he was drorvned, under the notion that ’
the Deity had leit his body, to go and inlrabit that 010
