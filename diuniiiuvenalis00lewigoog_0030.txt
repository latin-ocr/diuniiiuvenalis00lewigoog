INTRODUCTION. 9

XI, if indeed that satire did not suggest it·; of the latter
we may say that it wears an appearance of probability,
and that a perusal of the poet’s work will satisfy any
one that it represents a true tradition. If, sor example,

Satire 11. was composed in Domitian's reign, it is next to
- impossible that it should have been given 'to the world
till after the tyrant’s death.

When we turn from these Lives to the evidence fur·
nished by the only contemporary who mentions our poet,

wc get upon somewhat firmer ground, but we donet add
much to our knowledge. There is a Juvenal twice
directly addresscd, and once referred to, by Martial, aud
it seems almost certain that he is Juvenal the poet. On
sending him a small present, Maniai addresses him as

focrcodc Jereaolis, vii. 91 ; and it has been inferred, from Ι

the use of this epithet, either that sonre other man is
meante rhetorieian or a declaimer probably, and nota
poet, or that Martial was unaequainted with the poetical
writings of his friend. But those who have made this
observatien have not taken notice oi the fact that faceo-

v. 30; to poetry itself, xii. 43, sec-uades ocreas. At any
rate, whether Juvenal be here referred to as a poet or as
a declaimer, the epithet is generally applied by Martial
to a person of some reputation—Cicem, Seneca, Pliny
the younger, Nerva. &e There was therefore a friend of
Martial’s--a very intimate friend,vii. 24—named Juvenal,
whom he addresscs as an eloquent man living in Rome
in an. 93 (the date of the seventh book), and he was
still alive, or supposed by the writer to he alive, between
⁵ the years an. 100 and 104, when his name figures again,
xii. 18. ln this epigram, written in Spain, he is repre-
sented as wandering restlossly abent the town, and tiring
himself with his attendance upon great people. Agrea
