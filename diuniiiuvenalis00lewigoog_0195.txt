difficulty in secretus (ior which Heinrich reads securus on the

that the lover is hidden away and left to himself, i 9 5 3 and
this explains the next line. Of course, during the visit of
the doctor, the lover had to be concealed 238: paret,
“is all in a tremble oi eagerness.'’ In Hor. Sat. ii 7 69,

rei uourauitam consuetudinem auctus sum, ire hoc horum dicrum
otio, Cicerone uostro minore producendo, where, strangely,
Ernesti says he cannot understand the passage, and Schiita
proposes perducendo: the sense of prod. being, evidently, as
