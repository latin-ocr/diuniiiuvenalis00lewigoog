6 INTRODUCTION.

to the details* Suidas and a sababum on Juvenal
(iv. 38) are also in agreement with the other authorities
, as to this point. ·

But ou looking a little more closely at the soeafled
lile by Suetonius-undoubtedly the most ancient of ‚these
documents, and the only one which menits particular
attention-the difficulty in a great degree vanishes. It
is plain, on examinatiou, that two different actprs must
be intended-(1.) Theman on whom the poet’s satirical
lines were originally written, when, in middle age, he -
first took to this kind of composition; (2.) The man to
whom, long afterwards, ie, when an octogenariam he
applied them. This great interval of time is patent on
the face of the biography, and is confirmed by such
expressions as heae dia, the long while during which the
poet did not dare trust himself to an audience‚ and qicasc'
tempora (to which some MSS. add precantia) fiyura
notasset, as though he had covertly satirised the ttea

’ times. Now, putting aside externa] objections, which are
quite insuperable‚ it is inconceivable that the same Paris

who was a favourite player in J uvenal's prime should be
found ia deliciis aaziae (an expression as to which see note
to Sarire iv. 3) some sorty years afterwards! Two different
persons are evidently meant. The Paris named at the ¹
beginning must be either Nero's or Domitian’s favourite.
One of the transcribens, who has seen the point to which
attentionis being called, has supposed him to be the'
former, and has added after poetam the words Claudii
Neronia. But the difficulties in the way ol such a sup-
position are very great. If these lines were originally
composed ou the elder Paris towards the end oi his career ·
about nu. 67, and afterwards applied to the younger one,
we have not a sufficient interval ol time lest to account

* Seven oi these lives are given at the end of J abn's edition. There is
another lite given in Acbaintre, but evidently oi much later date.
