News reached him, it may be, of an occurrence in Egypt,
such as is afterwards described, and thinking it a good sub
ject, he proeeeded to versify it, seasouing it with moral reflec-
tious, after his manner. The people of Tentyra, as we learn
froin Strabo xvii 1 19, differed from the rest of the Egyptians,
in their hatred of the erocodile, cf. Plin, H. N. viii 2 5. On
theotherhand, thc.On1biteswere celebrated for their devo· ‚
tion to it. Mummies of crocodilos are, it is said, still found
in the adjacent catacombs, and the Roman coins of the
Ombite nome exhibit its effigy and that of the crocodile-

have known this much aud named his two parties to the

expression on the strength of which Juvenal is held to have
visited Egypt, and perhaps the foundation of this story in
the life ascribed to Suetonius. 46 : Canopo. Ribbeck cites
this passage as evidence that Juvenal did not write this
Satire. The writer, he says, contrasts Aeyypttas with Canopus,
and does not seem to know that the latter was in Egypt.
Whereas tho “real Juvenal'' did know the fact, as appears
from i 26 and vi 83 84. But, as Macleanc observes, “It was Π
no contradiction to speak of the barbariaus, as he calls them,

the Egyptians in general.'’ Strabo speaks of its dissolute
