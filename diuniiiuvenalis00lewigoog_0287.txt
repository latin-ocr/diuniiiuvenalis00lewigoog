Cimbri, ie, after the battle. 253: The noble colleague
was Catulus. The nobility of the family has been already
referred to, ii 146. There seems great doubt whether Catulus
was not eutitled to as much renown as Marius for his share
in the engagement. 254: P. Decernatur, father and son,

devoted themselves to death for the salse of their country, '

the first in the war against the Latius, the second in that
against the Gauls, Liv. viii 9, and x 28. In both cases they
devoted themselves Diis berrillos, cellamque. There was also a
legend of the grandson having done the same in the war againstx
Pyrrhus, Cic. Tuchuaest. i 37. Horace alludee to the plebeian
origin of the Decii, Sat. i 6 20. 259: ancilla natas, Servius ’

the shield made by Vulcan for Aeneas. In his illustratione,

of fact, Porsena conquered Rome. 266: The secret was
discovered at a supper-party by Vindicius, a slave. The
matrone mourned Brutus for a whole year, Liv. ii 7 ; and
so Juvenal speaks of Vindicius as luyendas. 268: legum,
“under the republic.'' This may perhaps be best explained
