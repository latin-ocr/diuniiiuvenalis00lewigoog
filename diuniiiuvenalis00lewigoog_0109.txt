negant laudo id quaqua: nepotatio, neco: ait, aio: postremo ice-
peravi eqomet ouili omnio assentari:ic camus nunc est multo
alarinum, Eun. ii 2; and Martial, who says ol one of these
adulators, Omnia laudabit, mirabitur omnia, donec Perpessus

So aliassaciee‚ xv 57. 106: A facie jactare mauce these
words, as wellas laudare, might depend on paratae. “Pre-
pared to blow a kiss, to signily his approval.’' Compare iv

interpret-atione ol this obscuro line ς ea qr„ “il with npturned
bottom the golden goblet smacks‚'' ie, ii the great man · -
drinks off a bumper at a dranght and smacks his lips, or, if

“Cottabos;'’ and Valer. Maus iii 2 ext. 6, quodque ea ec
( potione) superfuerat, jocabundus illisam hemo claram edere mum
coegit But neither of these meanings‘suits the context.
Britann. and Heinr. take aar. trel. as venter dauco, and ¹
saud. as aevo, giving to the whole the sense of si pepederit. I ⁴
think pedere or cacare is the sense, compare Mart. x 14 10 3
but trel. aar. for uenter dicitis is a very violent metaphor.
erui. aar. 1 take to be a homely domestic utensil‚ which
appears to have been made of gold in some cases. Ventris
onus misero, aec te pudet, excipis auaro, Mart. i 38, Lamprid
Heliog. 32, and not uncommonly ol silver, Plin Η. N. xxxiii
123 Petron. 27. The meaning might then be “ii this utensil‚
when placed under him, shall have given a crep. to his ina.
jan.,'’ i.e., shall have furnished him withan occasion lor, dvc.
“ Il he has a successful stool‚’' which, strange as it may sound
to our ears, is not incompatiblc with the manners os tho
period. sven. for an. is not elsewhere found. But no render-
ing or explanation is at all satisfactam* Or take 108 in one
ol the senses first indicated, and suppose something else to be
suggested· or, transpose 107 108. 113: iaceam,- above

⁴ In one Bodleian MS. which I examined, aureo has centon written over
it. And trulla=“pa” in middle-age Latin. Ducange. This shows how
some oi the lator transcribers understood the line.
