INTRODUCTION TO surius 1. ες

I should be inclined, therefore, to think thau the Satira l
was originally written iu the reign ol the tyrano, and pub-
· lished (when it had become sale to do so), nith additions, in
thasos Trajan. l
Il the barber mentioned at l 2 5 bo the tonsor tora notissimus
· urbs oi Martial, Cinnamus (vii. 64), uc should have another
slight indication to tho samo eliscu3 ior Cinnamus, altar his
great rise, had fallen before Aa). 93, the data ol Martial's
sevenih boola u is true triorche sarus line occurs at aa 226,
and this (to me) would serva to confirm the conjecture thar
Satira Χ., in its main lines, is a comparativcly early rhetorical
effusion of the poet.
