which add Pliny’s description oi his villa, ii 17. The rich
had summer and winter dialog-roomo, as appears from these
passages, and compare the pretty lines in Statius Silv. ii 2 45

186: sqq. Meanwhile such a manas Quintilian will
receive only fifteen guineas sor a course. But you tell me
Quintilian is rich and possesses large estates That may
be, but it only shows he is a lucky fellow and was born
undena fortunate star. Luck will do anything for a man.
Ventidius and Tullius may be cited as similar examples. But
these lucky follows are extremely rare. Most people gain
very little by the professorial chair. Look at Thrasymachus
and Secundus Carinas-look at Socrates himself l The pecu-
niary circumstances oi Quintilian have given rise to a great
deal of discussion. Here we have him represented as a large
landed proprietor, and there is 'reason tc suppose chat he‘
received a salary of some seven hundred a year from tha
State for tecching rhetoric, Suet. Vesp. 18.⁴ On the 'other
hand, the younger Pliny, who had been his pupil, sends him
a present ol about ,6400 English, towards the outlit of his
daughter, on her marriage, ·Epp. vi 32. (There are other
difficulties connected with this epistle, lor which and for
fuller details, the reader should consult the article “Quin-
tilianus,'' in Dict. G. and R. Biog.) Pliny speaks at the
same time of his moderate means. But what would appear
wealth to a poor poet like Juvenal would seem but a coin·
petency to a wealthy and generous nobleman likc,B1iny.
Moreover‚ in the epistle above quoted, the donor apologise‘s
ior not having sent a larger sirm, as he could only hope to
induce Quintilian to accept anything by the smallness of his
offering. “The man to whom this could be said must' be a
rich man,” as Macleane well observes, “though Pliny was
much richer.” It may be added that fifteen guincas fec from
every pupil-aud thisit seems is vvlrat ismcant in this
passage oi J uvenal-—would maha up a veryhandscme income,
when added to his State salary, ior a man who, like Quin·
tilian, had many pupils. Music-masters may have got a great
deal more 3 still this was something. 187: Ul mallum,
