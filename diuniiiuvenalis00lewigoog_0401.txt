378 NOTES.

not think that this is a case for dogmatising. 13: The mean-
’ ing is when Ulysses was relating his wonderful adventures to
Alcinous, King of Phaeacia (llorn. Od. ix). very likely he had
moved some of the company to wrath, or made them laugh
when he had begua to talk about Laestrygones and Cyclopes,
who fed on lnnnan flesh. “ Won’t some one pitch this fellow
into the sea‚'' we can imagine one of the guests saying, “with
his inventione about hage man-eatersl l could soonerswallow
the stories about Scylla, Circe, hc, than believe in such an
abomination as this. He must think ns mad.” In short,
such a monstrosity would not have been believed even in the
days of Ulysses. ll'ell, Iwill tell you what took place, in
open day, quite recently, in the consulship of Junius, among
these same Egyptians. Iwill relate a piece of cannibalism
which was the work, not of an individual, hut of a whole
people. 14: strper coenant. As in the case of Ulysses,
dianer-time, with the wine flowing, would be the natural
occasion for producing wonderful stories. Pliny tells a story
of a wonderful dolphin which he heard at a dinnerparty,
where all sorts of prodigies were related, Incidi eutem dunt,
suaper coenam, eurio acirocedo hinc inde referuntur, Epp. ix 33.

Augustus at his dinners, Suet. Aug. 74; cf. Porcellini and
Casauhon's note quoted there. They seem to have been a
kind of 'mock-philosophers, who doubtless improvised bur-
lesque discussions on such themes as virtue, iba, aad invented
stories in illustration of them, for the amusement'of their
patrous. ln putting what follows into the mouth of one of
the gnests‚ the poet exaggerates‚ as he often does3 his indig-
nation against the Egyptians causes him to overshoot the
mark Cannibalism has not at any time been so rare and
unheard-of a practice as he would imply. And if we realise
for amoment such a scene as the supper of Alcinous, we may
be sure that the stories about Laestrygones and Cyclopes
would not have appeared to the guests at all more wonderful
than the rest of Ulysses' narrative. To a modern audience,
they would form the least wonderful part of the tale, as
being the one most likely to have a baokgronnd of truth. cf.
Pliny, H. N. vii 2, who exhibite none of the incredulity of
