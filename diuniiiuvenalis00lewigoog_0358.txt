Thu poet sets to tvork to try and console oue Calvinus, who
1101 been robbed 01 asum ot' money by 0 1011111111 friend to
whom he had entrusted it. He tells the victim 111111 011 who
10011111111111001111101111111111, thet the cnse is ecomrnon one,
and that 1111 fortune is such 11101 he can very vell bear with
the loss. Excessive grief, in such a case, 11011101 place: the
experience 01 lile ought to help 111, just ns much ns philosophy,
to beer these things. The world is 1111101 regnes. ll’e ure
no longer living in the age 01 Suturn, when prohity and reve-
rence 101 age, and the other virtues, vvere practised. Now-ei·
days 011 honest man is a 1111111 craturae. And then, again, others ·
huvesnstained losses 1111111010 severe than yours; and see hotv
the swindling villains svvear 10 their innocence by all the gods
of heaven. Some oi these people don’t believe in gods 01 011,

and so they svvear with impunity; others do believe in them, ·

but rob you 0111110 same ond risk their enger; and, therefore,
they ure quite ready 10 take any 00111, and J upiter makes no
sign when they perjure themselves, and you begin to think 1111
statue no better than a dummy. ’

Novv, listen to the consolatione 01 one who does not pretend¹ ’ ’

to know much about philosophy. Your case is every plain
one, and requires uo skilled physician. 11 there vvere no other
example 01 similar villany on record, you might be permitted
10 indulge in weiling. But look ut the law-courts, look 01 the
thieves and incendiaries 11101110 henr 01, the sacrileges that
ere committed, the poisoners and parricides 1 Ah, 11 you could
only spend afevv days in the office 01 the chief 01 the police,
and hear all that lie 110111, you vvould cease 10 think yourself
10 wretched. l'ou would no more vvondcr at people in Rome
