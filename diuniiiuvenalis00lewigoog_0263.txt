242 NOTES.

rejoicet’' Compare Plaut. Aulai. v 110.11. Sir Samuel
Baher tells us that evea now the dn'ellers on the White Nile

will not cat the ox, aud this is probably au instance of ‘⁶ sur· ,

vival.'' exclamare libet. So Mart. x 31. 30: sqq. Dou't
suppose that a noble name is all that is required to make you
noble in reality. Dou't ne call duarfs Atlas, dact Takc
care then lest you be styled Creticus or Camerinus, oa the

“ same principle, ia, ironically. There isa slight digression , ,

here from the main line of argument. ll'e should rather ex·
1 pect, “take care then, lest, sor all that you may have a great
name, such as Creticus or Camerinus, it may be held to

imply very ignoble qualities.’' But the construction seems to
¹ demand the first rendering. Atlas seems to be the name of a
dwarf in Mart. vi 77 7. extortam, “ distorted,'' omaibas memoria
astutus et fractus, Plin. Epp. viii 18. Creticus, ii 67. Comari
aus, vii 90. The former was an agnomen of ‚the Metelli, first
bestowed on Q. Caecilius Metellus for his victory over the
Cretans, for which he had a triumph.

39, 40 : Rubelli Plauto. There is some difficulty here,
for Rubellius Plautus the sou ol Rubellius Blandus, by J ulia,
grand-daughter ol the Emperor Tiberius, was put to death,
al). 62, lougbcfore this Satire was written. th wc find him

spoken ol as still alive (riuos 46 tou aicit imago 55, aud the η

context generally). Most of the MSS. read Blande, and some
suppose the person addressed to have been a son of Rubellius
Plautus aud a grandson ol the first-named Rubellius Blandus.
But 42 Ut lc occeperat quoe sanquine fulget Juli is conclusive
against this. We have secu how common it is for Juvenal
to select types from the dead and speak of them as if still
living, Tigellinus i 155, Paris and Palaemon in vii, and
below 170, Nero, for the Emperor, for instance. We must
suppose this to be the case here, and that the name is put
for any one u'ho is puffod up with his birth, though, to me
at least, this is not quite satisfactory. But Ι sce no other
solution. Tacitus ¹gives Rubellius Plautus a more favourable
character, Anu. xiv aa. tecam est otili sermo, “ airord or two
nith you.'' 40: Drusorum stemmate. His mother dulia
was the daughter of Drusus; sec the “Stemma Drusorum,''
in Dict. G. aud R. Biog. toraca, the proper nord, see note to
