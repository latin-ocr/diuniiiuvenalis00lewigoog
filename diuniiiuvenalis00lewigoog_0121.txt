100 NOYES.

vi 415 416. 236-238: At this time aa a rule the circula·
tion ol vehicles wus forbidden in the streets of Rome, during
the greater part ol the day-light hours. There were certain
exceptions, as, for instance, in the case of carte bringing in
buildin g materials (below 2 54 sqq.) There were other excep
tiens, mentioned by Friedlh'nder, “hlanners of the Romans,’'
Book i, to which it would seem, lrom this satire, there might
be added the case of removal from town to the country (ro,
316), hence the night-trutlic was particularly noisy. Seneca
has humorously described the noises of the night in Epp.
122. hiartial complains ol the murulrae. Vixque datur longus· ,
mulorum rumpere masuras, Mart. v za 7. mandra is properly

are described by the same author as very sleepy, uultum
animal grauiore semuo preuu'tur, H.N. ix 13 ; Virg. Georg. iv
43²· 239: ci uocat off. ast uocat officium. Pers vi 27.
The meaning here, as there, may be simply “If there is a
call on him.'’ 240: Liburniam slaves from the-north of
Illyricum were much in favour at Rome as chairmen, criers,
dec, iv 75, vi 477. They were doubtless strapping lellows
horridus Liburnus, Mart. i 50. Liburno is here, according to
Macleaue, the dative case, aud the construction is super orn
Liburno, “ over his head‚'’ not over the people's heads 3 but
this, 1 think, is wrong. hlr. Munro (adi 13.·Mayor's ed.)
seems to understand “ He is elevated over people’s head by

· the huge stature of his Liburnians,'' making lugenti Liburnae =

proceritatc Liburnorum ; and this may be the correct render·
ing. 242: This line is pronouuced to be spurious by
