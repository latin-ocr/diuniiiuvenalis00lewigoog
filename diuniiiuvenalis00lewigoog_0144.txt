ritate publica operetur. Plin. Epp. viii 6. 129: Fabricio.
This is Veiento, whose name was Fabricius Veiento. Horace
makes his epicure say, Piscibus atque acidus quae naturaei soret
aetas Arate areum nulii patuit quaesita polutum, Sat. ii4 45. Here

the meaning is, If Fabricius Veiento could only hare indicated ·

the age and the country of the fish, his information about it,

Intestiuas meas uouerat, tanturuque aaa dixerat quid pridie werra·
ueram, 76. 130 : censes, conciditur, the present, as in Iu qua
te quaero proseucha? iii 296. Quem sequimur? Virg. Aen. iii
88. quae prima pericula rito? Id 367, Catull. i 1, dte.

131: testa alta paretur. deerat pisci patinae mensura, 72, and

ii 4 32, and Pliny says, raeque dulciora, rupere teneriora esse ulla

Lucrini delicatior stupri, Mart. v 37, and often elsewhere.
From these passages it would appear that Lucrine and Cir·
caean oysters were in about equal favour. The fondness of
the Romans for oysters is well known, cf. ri 302. The autho·
rities on the subject are summed up inan article of the
Edirrburph Ilerieu· for 1867. llutupiae is Richborough in
