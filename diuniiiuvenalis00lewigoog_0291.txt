1, but this verse has apparently slipped in from the
margin, where it occurred as the note ol a render. Il it is
Jur.'s, it is clearly out of place. 6, 'lt Crepereius Pollio
is a spendthrilt who goes about offering three times tho
amount of legal interest (aa, thirty-six per cent.) for a
loun, but can find no one foolish enough to adrance tho
money. Pollio, as a spendthrift, occurs again at xi 43. 10:
uanam equitem Martial has the same expression in i 85,

the sense is not the same. The mun speaks of himself as a
cliens at 59 72. 11 : saliua iutra pomeria uatis, ia, colibus

recovering from a sever, and in the first stage ol recovery,'' on
