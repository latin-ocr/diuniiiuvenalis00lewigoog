ι ¹92 NOTES.

Another reading is aereum. 446: The enthymema (ἐνθύμημα)
is described, in several places, by Quintilian, who says that
there is no Latin word corresponding to it, aud that it is
better to use the Greek word, as Juvenal does here. As an
example ol the enthymema, he gives the following :-“ That
is good of which uo one can make abad use. No one cau make
abad use of virtue. Therefore virtue is good.'' We have here
a perfect syllogism. Nou, it we say “virtue is good, because
no one can make a bad use ol it‚” ave have an enthymema.
Here it appears as a syllogism, with one premiss suppressed,
or understood. And this has always been afavourite weapon,
in argument, with women. But it olten has merely the sense
oi quaestiuncula. As to the sort of inquinare with which the
Romans used to amuse themselves alter diuner, cf. Aul. Gell.

the meaning is, “is mistress of,'’ “recollecta'’ This sense
