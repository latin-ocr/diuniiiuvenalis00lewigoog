Tau poet addressing a parasite whom he calls Trebius, tells
him that it would be iar more respectable to go abegging
than to continue to toady his patron for the sake of an occa·
sional dinner. And what sort ol a dinnerl This furnishes
‚ the author with the opportunity ol giving a fancy picture oi
one oi these repasts, which laste to the end of the Satire
The poor hunger-on gets execrable wine, while the host revels
in the choicest vintages: Virro (the host) drinks out of jevel-
led and embossed cups‚ Trebius from gloss ol the communest
kind, very often cracked into the bargain: the former basa
costly young slave, from Asia, ior his cupbearer, the latter
is served by an ugly bluckamoor. So, oue eats bread of the .
choicest wlreat-flour, the other has stuff given him which he
can't get his leeth through. For Virro, a noble lobster‚ aud
the finest olive-oil, aud a mullet, and a lamprey, and choice
poultry, and truffles: ior Trebius, a common crab, oil that
stinks oi the lamp, an cel like a snake, a frostbitteu pike,
and the like. And all the while, he does not venture to open
his mouth, or address the great man, who, ol course, never
asks him to drink, or takes the slightest notice of him
How different-asks the poet in a parenthesis-all this
would be, ii Trebius suddenly came into a large fortune.
⁸ Then, what attention on the partos the host! ‘⁶ Help Tre·
· hius! serve Trebius! do, my deur friend, talne some stuffing.'’
And suppose Trebius were childless into the bargain, why he
would become mosterol the house!

Resuming his account oi the meal, Juvenal says the rich
man aml his rich friends eat mushrooms and the fiuest fruit:
the humble dependants get doubtful-loolring funguses aud
¹ apples such as are given to monkeys. Aud quite right too,
