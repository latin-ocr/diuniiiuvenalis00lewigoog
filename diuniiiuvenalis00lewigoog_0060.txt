perhaps uyitrm again, in the sense oi “to meditate,” “to
’ design ’' (Iu rrreouur uyilaus auido, Ter. ; Nutu utrae uatium uyitom
audito, Livy). And aiter Heracleus supply suuldus. So Lucanos
for Lucanos uyros, viii 180. These ellipses are very common
· in Juvenal. The sense is, “ Why should I pnrsue snch thread·
bare and profitless thomos as the labonrs of Hercules, the
wanderings of Diomede, the bellowings of the Minotaur in
the Cretan labyrinth, Icarus trying to tly and falling into the

may be alluded to here. Indead the question is hardly worth
fighting over in company with some commentatore. Juvenal,
as a poet, had possibly arnt nrnch more knowledge ol* the
Roman law (turtureum si aori ciuilio jaro, says Horace) than our
own yroets possem, for the most part, of our larus, and he
himself might have been unable to tell us w'lmt statute, if any
in particular, he alludes to. He says, “ The wife geta a legacy,
and if she can’t take, her husband comes forward in her place,
and his name goes into the will ; '' and that must be sufficient
for us. 57: eiyilouti stertere uusa- rr'yilaas stertis, Lucret.
