244 NOTES.

amus equum, “we praise the horse as swift,” below 161,
dominum reponique salutat, “salutes him as,'' &c The Romans,
however, thought a great deal os the pedigrees of their racers,

cf. Stat. Silv. v 2 21, sqq. volucr. seems to have been anemo

given ιο horses, Capit. Ver. 6. pulmo, “ the palm oi victory.”
Primaque aecelcsia palma petetur aquia, Ov. Fast. iv 392· Others

take it “ of the clappiug of hands by the spectators.'' 59:

rauco Circo, so uicinia rauco, in Hor. η 60, 61: will not fail

to attract notice, both from the sentiment and the rhythm.
(lump. Acer equus mundam magnaeque ia puluere samue, Ov.

Met. vii 54²· loayusque a Caesare puluis, biart. x 6 5. 62:
Corythoe. Ol this mare nothing further is known. Coryphaei

· aud Coryphaeus (equally unknown) are other readings. 63:
Hirpinus was a celebrated racer mentioned by Martial, who

says of abusybody who affected ιο know everything‚ Hirpini
ueteres qui boue auoit ceos, iii 63 12. It seems that Lipsius
copied an inscription on a stone at Rome, with tho words
Hirpinus napos) Aquilonis vicit cxii secaadas tulit lvi tert. tul.
xxxvi. 66 z Q, from ἔτι· and the Gallio reda. This

· word is noticed by Quintilian, Inst. Or. i 5. The scholiast
issi& says they were ornamenta redarum aut plaustro. They were
either vehicles or something connected with vehicles 3 that is

· all we can say. 67: Nepotis, this man must have been a⁴
well-known baker or millcr. Some of the bakers' mills,
which were usually turned by asses, or by slaves ior punish-

ment, are to be seen at Pompeii. The poet says these slow‘
horses were fit to take their places at such mills. Ribbeck

has aepulas, which is ingenious. See above inscript-ion on
Hirpinus, 63, note. 68: da. Heinrich takes this as
equivalent to suc. Macleaue says, iu his off-hand way, “It
means, ‘tell me,' as in Virg. Ecl. i 19, Sal tamea istc Deus qui ’
ait du Τ hyre, aclis, and Hor. Sat. ii 8 4.'' No doubt dore often
has this sense, as agaiu iu Ter. Prolog. ud Heaut. Tim. ro,
'nunc quuawbrem has partes didicerim, paucis dabo. Quia. . .
tot templa tat orus Promeruisse datur? “is said ιο have,'' Stat.
Silv. iii 3 79 3 Ov. Fast. vi 434. But here it may mean either,
and is periectly translated by· tho English “give me.’' Iu iii
137, du testem llcmue tuuc salictum, hc, the sense is ‘⁶ produce,''
