there is a double-eruente in se secisse-that she had put up the
tomb, or done for her husbands. The expression is ironical.
Seneca says thatsome noble ladies designated the years, not
by the names of the consuls, but by those oi their husbands
for the time being, de Benef. iii 16. ,

231-241 : The mother-inlaw, that never-failing butt for
satirists, is introduced h'o hope for you, while she is alive t

onerosa pallia yectct, which is an expression proper to a sick .
or restless person, and he quotes Oi. Her. xxi 169, At milei,
eee miserae! torrentur febribus artus, Et grauius justo pallia·
