this had been anywhere nearcho truth, it might indeed have
been said in the words ol Herodotus, ὡς lai κακῷ ἀνθρώπου .

The “one pris0n'' was the Carcer Mamertinus, said to have
been built by Ancus Martius, Livy, i 33, and which has
recently (1872) been choroughly explored3 “a passage, eighty
yards long, nearly two high and one wide, having'been
excavated,'' according to aletter iu the Pinus, dated March
18th. Mr. Long, Cic. Cat ii 10, seems to implythat this
was the only prison in Rome in Cicero's time. But this is
clearly ont oi the question. cf. Bnrn. Rome, ka, p 80.
316: Here the carriage comes up and the friends take leave ’
oi each other. Becker, Gall. sc. 4, takes this differently. He
supposes the carriage to have been waiting outside the gnte

, the whole time. In that case 10 must mean not ‘⁴ achile his

things are being packed np,’' but “his things 'being all ready
packed,” asense it will hardly hear. B. fonnds his view on au
edictos Claudius forbidding travellors to drire through the ⁴
towns of Italy in a carriage. Suet. Claud. 25. But the edict
does not seem to have been very strictly observed (cl. Friedl.
vol. i, p. 41, Fr. ed.),and it does not follow, because carriages
were not allowed in the streets ol Rome, that what we might
style a furniture-ranwas noc permittcd. How otherwise could
furniture, eka, have been transported from one quanter to
anotherl Iu any case U.'s vehicle could have corne alter him
in the alteruoon of a summer day. (Friedl. loc. cit. which
would correspond with the indicatione here.) In the same
strain, Martini concludes the tenth book oi his epigrams, Jom
lumidus vocat moyisler, castigetque aumas . . . eale libelle! x
104 16, and Calpurnius at the end of his Filth Eclogue has
something still more like it, Plura qudem monuisse aelim: .
nom pluro supersunt. Sed jam sera dies codil. cf. note to vii
