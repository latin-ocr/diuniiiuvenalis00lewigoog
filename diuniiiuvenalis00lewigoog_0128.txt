SATIRE 111. 107

’ and this might be better. annuere generally means “ to nod as·
sent.’' 319 : tuo Aquino, perhaps “yourfavouriteAquinum,”

’ So Persius has arreum naara. Suetonius, Liriac . . . Veientanum

. sirum reuisenti, her villa at Veii, Galb. 1. From this line, the
authors of some of the early lives of Juvenal, and avast
number of subsequent critice, have derived the idea that
Juvenal vvas bornat Aquinum Il we translate luo Aurana,
“your Aquinum,'' leaving it uncertain why it was called
“ yours,’' we shall be sale. Beyond this, all is me'ro conjecture:
320: Heluinam occurs nowhere else; arrd why this name is
given to Ceres, we do not know. From coins found at Aquino
it would soem that the old town Aquinum was sinder the
protectior of Minerva. An engraving is given of one in Dict.
Gr. and a Geog. Inscriptions have also been discovered
showing the existence of various temples there, the ruins of
sorae ol which are still to be seen, arrd doubtlcss there was one
ol Ceres. Aa inscription has been found, and is given by
Mommsen, l. a. X. 4312. (Cenchr, sacrum (D. luchrius Iuarrralr's

poet, and that ri is to be filled up, so as to make Cereri.

meaning probably is, simply, “I will put on my travelling
boote, and set off to pay yon a risit.’' Umb. represents duv.

asks his irile to write him two letters a day from Campania

to llome. But Pliny was a rich man.
