INTRODUCTION To SATIRE V. 127

concludes the poet 3 Virro does all this on purpose to annoy
you Wherc is there a more amusing sarce to be seen than
disappointed gluttonyl “ Il you consent to stand this treat
ruent, you deservo it ; ii you go on in this way, toadying Virro
for the salre oi dinners, at which you are purposely insulted,
we shall see you before long on the stage, in the character of

pantaleon, to be kiched and thumped and knoclrcd about for
the delight of the audience l ’'

There is nothing in this Satire to enable us to determine
the date. Is line 36 be an allusion to the fate ol Senecio,
condemned to death by Domitian l'or writing a panegyricon

Helvidius Priscus (which is more than doubtful), the dicte
would be aiter nn. 9 5.
