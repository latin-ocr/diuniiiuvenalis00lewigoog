262 NOTES.

Nero into the Satire, the poet not unnatnrally contrasts Seneca

with him, but it would have been more in accordauce with the
general argument, ii the latter had been a man oi low birth,
which he was not. Some commentatore have thought, from
' the way in which Nero is ‹lwelt upon, that the first drait of
this Satire was probably written during his reign or shortly
after his death. But it is clear that Juvenal wishingto illus·
tratc his theme, Stemmata quid secuml? by the example of an
emperor, among others, could not' have chosen one more recent
than Nero. For Galba he huda partiality. Otho and Vitel· Ι
lius were of no remarkable deseent, and the Flavians of humble
origin. And Nero fite in with aud was perhaps suggested by
what has preceded about the stage. Lib. ei dentur, so Livy

Suetonius alleges that noue were punished in this way who
had not cout'essed their guilt, Aug. 33. Nero was, strictly
speaking, guilty of only one parricidium (or two, if he really
heda hand in the death of his father by adoption, Claudius,
Suet. Nero, 33), thus punishahle,-that of his mother Agrip
pina; but he murdered his wives Octavia and Poppaea,

murdered Antonia, daughter of the Emperor Claudius, his ·
