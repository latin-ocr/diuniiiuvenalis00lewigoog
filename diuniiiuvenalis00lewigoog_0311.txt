84: victus. Ribbeck objects to this epithet. Tiberius (Ajax)
was not cicius. There is certainly force iu this objection.
But the poet has in his mind the legendos Ajax conquered
by Ulysses, and the mad roge which seized on him after his
defeat, when he butchered the sheep, thinking they were his
enemies. So the speaker is represented as fearing that a
similar butehering frenzy will scize Tiberius, whom he com-
pares ιο Ajar, and, as Ajax uas conquered, he affixes the

epithet victus to him, without seeming ιο notice that it does -

not fit Tiberius. “I am afraid that ne are going to have a
repetition ol the story of conquered Ajax-an indiscriminate
massacre.'' There is something not unlike this in ii 109,
where moestu is applied ιο Cleopatra, because the epithet suits
'her generally, while it does not suit her at the particular
moment to which it is made to refer. 88, 89: 1ιί amantes
