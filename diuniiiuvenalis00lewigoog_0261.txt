240 NOTES.

Mart, xiv 155, classes wool as follows: Velleribus primis ,
Appulia, Parme secantis Nobilis, Altinum tertia lentat cois.
. Altinum, a town of Venetia, would most nearly correspond
to the district here alludcd to. Martial says of a girl that
she is Ayno Geleis mollior Phalantini, v 37 2, in a compli-
mentary sense. 16: Carine (catania) was at the foot of
Aetna, and the stones throvvn up ογ tbe volcano were no
doubt used for rubbing the body, tl'arn¹ res mortifero est ireimicas
pumice levis, ix 95. Pometia nese corporum locipandornm sentinis,
jorn quidem et viris, Plin. H. N. xmrvi 21. On this practice of
the effeminate Romans, of smoothing the body with pumice-
' stoue, dec, aud pulling out the hairs, cf. Mart. ii 29 6, Et
splendent trito brachiu salse pilo, where splendent means “ shino
with friction,'' Juv. ii 123 Pers. iv 40. The tvvo last passages
explain tombam here. Sueton. J. 0. 45; Otho, 12. Lucilius
enumeratos all the processes to which the effeminate sub·
jected themselves, findor, subcellor, desq'nemor, poenitor, nnec,
Eapolior, pinyor, Fr. vii 5 ; Plaut. Poen. i 2 10. 17:
Squalentes, “ rugged,” incontrast to the artifieial smoothings
of their degenerare descendants. intonsi aei, Tibull. ii 1
34. troducit, “dishononrs,'' “exposes to contempt,'' ii 159,
vii 16. blartial often uses the word iu the same sense, i 54,
“ dec. tredaci, iu this sense, means literally to be led along iu ·
public ογ vvay of disgrace. Sueten. uses itin its literal sense
in Tit. 8, where, hythe Emperor’s orders, informers aud
suborners are scourged, ue noeissirne tradenti per Amphitheatri
areauna, previously to being sold as slaves. ln some parts of
Spain, it was the custom some years ago, and is perhaps still,
to promenede a condemned malefactor through the town,
previous to his execution, mouuted ou an ass. Hence meta-
phorically, as here, “brings disgrace upon.’' 17,18; emp
torpne . . . pentem. And, a convicted prisoner, brings

disgracc upon his unhappy family, by having his image
broken up. frangendo iereopine, “the breaking up of his
image.’' Busts and statues of those vrbo had been found
guilty of a capital crime, as treasou‚ dc, vvere often delivered
up to be destroyed by the executioner. So of Sejanus,
descendunt stotnne restemque separantur, x 58. funestare is
