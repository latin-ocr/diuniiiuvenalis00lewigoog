ment is to be accepted as a historical fact, is quite another

question The legend (if legend it he) seems to have
been received as history in the fifth damry* lt may
be remarked oi the series oi Lives ol which this forms
one, that they give us, in many cases (ey, in that oi
Persius), inlornration which bears the appearance of being
genuine, and collected near the times oi which they trent.
On this subject peges might bewritten, indeed, hove been
written, with very little profit. All that can he said ia,
that the statement as it stands in the text isaot “im-
possible'’ To accept the story of the exile, and then to
transpose it to some other period oi J nvennl’s lile, as some
commentators have done, is merely hnilding in the clouds

The only other portione oi the Life which merit atten-
tion are thatin which the author speaks oi Juvenal
having practised declamation, and the sort oi intimation
which he gives ol the poet’s habit ol retouching his
satires, and inserting in those of later date passages com·
posed at an earlier period These statements receive
some confirmation from an examinationes the Satires
themselves, and ore valuable chiefly as showing the early
tradition on the subject. To this may perhaps be added
the notice of the poet’s easy circumstances, and oi his
reluctnnce lor a long while, to gire his works to the
¹ public. The former statement is supported by Satire

quorum praecipuos suit Maximinus quem Paridis nomine nuncupavit''-
capitolin L Verus, viii, and others besider; cs. Friedliinder’s “Mannera
oi the Romans‚'’ vol. ii. p. 322, French ed. lt is not at all unlilrely, then,
thet there may have been a favourite actor named Paris in Hadrian’n time,
though it is not necessary to suppose this.

N. B.-'1’he insertion in Satire vn. must be from 88—92, not merely the
lines 90-923 this results irom this Lile itsell. The porta mmeritis ndi·
tiolir tumens is referred to iu 88, 89 ; and 93 follows naturally on 87.

* There can be small doubt that Sldonius Appollinaris refers to duvenal
in the line«, where, aiter mentioning the banishmcnt ol ovid, he adds-

“ Nec qui coneimili deinde cusu
Ad rulyi tenuem strepentia annm
Irati luit histrionis exsuL”-Carm. ix. 270.
