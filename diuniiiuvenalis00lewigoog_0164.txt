of note, inverse, by the transcriber. Perhaps this isa con·
venient place for observing that there is no writer ol anti·
quity with regard to whom commentatore should be more
oarefnl not to exclude these sententiae as glossas. They are
entirely in the poet’s manner: and the proof ol this is that
they constantly occur, either as parts of a line, or cover-
ing more than one line, so that they cannot be torn from '
the context Compare rara ia tenui facundia panno, vii

19, xiii 75 76,196 97, x. 7 8, dc. The meaning is that if the

rich man’s wife is barren, she will make his friends very ⁰

pleasant to him, for they will hope to get a legacy by
their attentione, or, that the sterility oia wife will make
him a pleasant friend. The epithet carus is in favour ol
the latter rendering, Carus erit Verri, iba, iii 53. Mipula
There are various readings of the name, bnt whichever ol
them we adopt, I think the man's wile is meant She is in·
troduced as Procula in iii ²03· The meaning Ι take to be,

“But under present circumstances, your wile may have as ·

many children as she likes. Virro won’t be distressed at the '
fact, as he knows he has nothing to expect from you, and
will be rather amused with them than otherwise.” This
Macleane says is “certainly wrong.'’ He takes the meaning
to be :-“ Now that you are rich-as we have supposed-
even if you have children, lie will fondle the babies and see
what he can do that way. The man being rich is still worth
looking after.'' In that case we should read iuna in prefer-
ence to natac, and the words parasitus infans seem to me to be
fatal to this rendering. If this be merely a pursning of the
idea that the man has become worth n knights iee, 132, and
is himself a great man, he and his children would surely cease
to be “parasitos” and would cometa table on terms of
equality with the host. Mr. Prior makes ipsc refer to patria
“The father will be delighted whenever his own parasita
child comes to his own table, and will order him to receive a
little bib-monoy,'' &a Mr. Prior 'says “it is strange that
this should have been overlooked !'' 143: viridem clearco.
