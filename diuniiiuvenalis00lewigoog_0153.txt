G. and R. Ant. “Vinum’' Horace speaks oi codem Marsi
memorem duelli, Od. iii 14 18, wine ol the Social War period,
which would then have been seventy, and, attho date ol this
Satire, something like a hundred and eighty years old. The
practice os a host setting down inferior wine to his guest,
while reserving a choicer vintage sor himself, would not, of
course, be tolerated in our day, but seems to have been
’ common in that ol Juvenal. Pliny the younger describes a
dinner where the host cinam eliam pertalis lacunariis in leia
yeneno decerpserat, aaa at poteslas eliyeadi, sed ae jas esee recu
eundi. Et aliud sibiet aclis, aliud euirrorilnnamhis (acm gradatim

According to Stacher, a somcwhat analogous custom prevailed

but was pushed across from the lowest rector on the one side
to the opposite incumbent.'' 32: Cardianus necabar was
an affection of the stomachi, sor which, Pliny says, the only
remedy was wine. Bibere et seculare eila cardiuci est, Sea. Epp.

highly, as promoting digestion. hiartial repeatedly praises
Setine, vi 86, x 13, and 36, &e Compare Juv. x 27· Sezza,
the modern place, makes wine which is, I believe, deemed
very inferior. titulant, alluded to in note 30-31, is the French
“e'tiquette.'' Petronius, 34, describes onc of these tituli as
being written on parchment, and hung round the neck of the
battle, and this is probably correct. He gives the “ titulus,’'
