of diminutives by some poetar poets 3cf. Wordsworth, “ Frag-
ments and Specimens ol Early Latin,'' p. 644. Monychus, ¹one ol
the centaurs. Heinrich thinks that the whole of this passage,
8-11, is a parody on Valerius Flaccus, the contemporary of
Juvenal, and the author ol the “ Argonautica'' Certainly there
are some passages in V. Flaccus which bear out this view,
while trado atita (lason) sortitae detularat ιιιιιιιιιι Pell italae, applies

our author, we might have supposed him to have had also in
his eye 597, sqq. of Phars. v.) But the other instantes of
parody cited by Heinrich are, I think, saucilnl. Itis not
· very likely that all Juvenal’s illustrations would be taken
from one author, whose worhs had been given to the public
some thirty years, aud who had himself been dead sonte ton
years before this Satira appeared, at any rate, in its present
form-and that, a very distinguished one, praised by Quin-
tilian, the first critic of the age, and osten imitated by
J uveual’s favourite, Statius 3 aud it ought to be shown that
