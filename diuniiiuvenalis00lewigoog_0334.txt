SATIRE ΧΙ. 3¹³

be any imitation at all, hut if so, it is more likely to have
been the other way. Martial's tenth book was published in
an. 99, iu its present form, but there had been a previous

edition as he informs us, x 2, in which this epigram may have ,
appeared. Supposing it, however, 11 have appeared for the
first time in the second edition, I am inclined to think that
this Satire is of later date. Iu ²03 the poet seems to speak
of himself as an old man Not, however, that 111 much
weight should be attached to this, especially in the case of a
satirist. The late Mr. Thackeray in some of his writings
speaks of himself as an old man at 1 time when he was about
forty years of age, and Persius iu his prologue certainly hints
at poverty being the cause of his writing, which we know was
not the case, and again speaks of his old agai 9, caeciliae (though
some choose to give it a different sense). Any number of such
instaures might be adduced, yet if we are to indulge in conjec-
ture, Ι think it would be safer 11 conjecture that Juvenal copied
from or parodied his friend llartial thau the converse. Com-
