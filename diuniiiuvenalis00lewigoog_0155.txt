a cobhler, but afterwards a fawonrite of Nero, gave his
name to a drinking-cup, for what reason itis now impossible
to say, perhaps from the length of his nose, which made it look
like a spent. It is mentioned by hlartial xiv 96, Vilia sanas

would be sold.'' But a comparison of the passages which he
himself cites from Pliny and from Martial will show that thero

being mended : the latter of their being sold. No, doubt, as
with us, valuable glass abjecte would be mended (if the Romans
