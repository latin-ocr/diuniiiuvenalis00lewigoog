man is already as good as dead; his existence cannot be dig·
nifed with the name of life-life is something more than mere
breath.’' This is, 1 think, areminiscence of Seneca, with whom
the sentiment is a very favouritc one, Epp. 603 Wcit isqui se
uider, qai cero latitent et torpeat sic in domo suet, lenrqaom ia eon·
ditiec. . mortem enom aiitceessereai, and another passage to
the same effect in Epp. 77, and in Epp. 93, Alter post mortem
quoque est, alter orric mortem periit, and Epp. 122, and again, Noa
eat erpo otiosus hic, uliud acmen imponor, ceper est, immo metues
est, de Brev. Vit 13. cf. also Cic. Sex. Rosc. Amer. 39. Gom·
pare also 80 81, sqq„ with a passage in Epp. 66, cir'benee . . .
stertire licei coruscaret tortor atque ipris, perseverabit. It is quite
clear that the works of Seneca were well known te, and often

sentiment, Plaut. Capt. iii 5 32, qai per rirfcdem perilot, af aon
interii. 85: ostrea, iv 141, note. ‘⁴ However sumptuously he
may fare.'’ Mouut Gaurus was near the Lucrina lake, hence
Lucrina oysters are meant. Cosmus was a celebrated per·

emus, i 88 2. Cosmi redoleat alabastro, xi 8 9, dec. eene is
the copper in which he prepared his unguente

Maximus on his appointment to the province of Achaia'very

of the province.'’ The provinces were iu general governed.
by their own laus. See Plin. Epp. x 110, where Trajan writes
to Pliny very strongly on this subject. qaid Cierio mandet.
The governors of provinces received their orders, rescripta, from ys
the emperor (many interesting specimcns of those sent by
Trajan are to be found in Plin. Epp. x), and were practi-
