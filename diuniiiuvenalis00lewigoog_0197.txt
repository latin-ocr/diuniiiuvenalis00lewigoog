176 NOTES.

Unless, indeed—as may be the case,-sheis preparing herself
lor real, and not simulated, combats. ll'omeu, as we have
seen, i 22, did sometimes descend into the arena 253:
cirea amat. So above, najaram estquod omont. circs is
used for strong men in xv ¹04 Here it seems to mean
masculine strength. 254: quantula noma voluptas. How
small is our pleasure (in comparisou with thoirs)! Tbis does
not need more particular explanation. 255: lt is better
to take rernm with conjuyis not with decas, as Heinrich pro·
fers. Quale decus reram, and coajrcyis auctio would he, to say .
the least, not usual expressions; whereas quaa decus and
rerum conjugis auctio offer no difficulties, aud the sense is
much improved. 257, 258: ecl . . .pccella. Tharais
some difficulty in this passage, in consequence oi our not
possessiug precise informatiou as to the different kinds oi
armour worn by the Roman gladiators. Heinrich says,
“ocrcac, which the Samnites did not incar, hut all the other
kinds of gladiators did.’' But this is certainly wrong, for the
Samnites did wear ocreae. See the engrnviugs in Dict. G.
aud R. Aut, article “ Gladiatores.” Moreover, the Samnites
were so called from their being armed in the same way as
that people, aud iu Livy, ix 40, we read expressly oi them,
sinistrum crus ocrea tectam. On the other hand, the retiarius,
from the very nature ol liis mode oi fighting, certainly wore
uo greayes 3 no moro, probably, did the secutor or the Thracian
(see the above-mentioued engravings). Itake the meaning,
therefore, to be, “or, if your wife takes to another mode oi
fighting, and adopts the accontremeuts oi a light—armed gladi-

ator, what a happiness to you tosee her sell her greavesi'’ , .

The whole passage is highly satirical. Macleaue thinks there
is no point in this, but 1 think there is He supposes the
meaning to bc, “When she gives up her lollies in the arena,
and goes back to her wantonness.’' 258: puella, “young
wife,” ii 59 note. 260: Femineam lucet sic per boncbycicao
corpus, Mart. viii 68 7. tenuia bombycina, xiv 24 3 “silk”
See Dict. G. aud Il. Ant. “Sericum” cyclos was a circulor
robe with a gold border, perhaps made ol muslin. 261:
monstratos perferat ictas, comparer 122, peragat dictata maynerii
262, 263: qccanta poplitibus sedeat is translated by differo,
