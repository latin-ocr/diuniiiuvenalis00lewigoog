were some sort os minoe-ruent madoci the intestines oi the
pig. They may have been like our sansages. They are
mentioned by Mart. i 42 9 10, fumantia qui tomacla raucus
Circumfert lepidis coquus popinis, and Petron. 31 (according to
one reading), and 49. 356: royc bononi nantem, bouum
ualetudinem orcimi, deiude corporis, Seu. Epp. 10. 357:
mortis icrrorc, the principal cause of man’s unhappiness,
according to Epicurus. 358: l have given in the trans·
lation the sense usually attached to these worrls3 upon which
Ribbeck has an entraordinary criticism, to the affeci that the
real Juvenal never would have spoken of extremum iiiuc spolium
'as a blessing, because every one, evenis he die in infancy,
must have “a lost stage '' of his lile. Surely it is unnecessary
to reply to this. Iam by uo means sure, however, that the
line does not mean, “who reckons mere length oi life the .
smallest of nature's boons.’' At 188 spolium uitae isund
expressly sor “long lile,'' aud as equivalent to inultos annos,·
and precisely in this sense does Seneca use the word Epp.
49, dccc noa csse posit-um borram vilae in spolio ejus, scd in usu.
There could be no objection to the expression ectrcruuru iuter
munero (as suns once suggested to me by a scholar), any more
than to primus incorpores, orolor unus iuter omues, &a 360 z
Nesciat irasci, in our idiom, “is incnpnble ol' onger,'' as at xi
100, Tunc rudis cl Graios mirari nescius ories . . . ruilus. Mao-
rebius has quoted part· oi this line, as Gronovius noticed‚
Fortitudinis passiones ipuorcrc, uon uincere, ut nesciui irasci, cupiat
nihil, Iu. Soron. Scip. ich. 8. loboris at the end of 359 and
361, with potioris at the end oi 360 (cf. 103 104, note), is
certainly notsuggestive of the “liniue lnhor.” pluma, properly,
“a fenther-bed,’' is here used for luxury, vi 88. 365: luobus
· is the readingol most MSS. P. reads*abest. Lactantius, in
bk. iii oi his InstituteS, “de Falsa Sapientia,'’ quotes these
lines as follows Nullum curren obesi, si sil prudcrrlic, scd uos
Tc sacimas fortuna deum coeloque locamus· ct least they ore so
printed in the early editions of Lact. He may have quoted
from memory; at auy rate his authority is not decisive.
