SATIRE 111. 99

lizards being so numerous in Italy that it would be next
to impossible to be the owner of a gurdon, however small,
in the country, without finding, at some time or other,
a lizard upon it. “It is something to have a bit of laud ef
one's own, however minute it may be.''

232: sqq. The sense here is somewhat obscure. Itake
the meaning to be “Many au invalid (ie, of the poorer class) ,
dies here from not being able to get to sleep—his disease
itself being caused by indigestion. For how ean one sleep in
a garretl Ilieh rnen cau sleep, it is true.’¹ arim refers back
te the first clause, and explains why they are kept atrahe.
sed-stomacho is thrown in parenthetically. ‘⁶ hnligestion brings
on the illnesS, and want of sleep kills the patient,'’ l'lacleane.
ipsicrn for illum is better, and there is MS. authority for it.
ll'hy undigested sood should be represented as the chief
cause of sickness, it is difficult to see.- lt might be said to be
the cause of rich men's indispositions, but that would not suit
the context. Below we are told that sleeplessness is the
cupra nterii. Itis impossible to make anything satisfactory
out of all this, and there is a confusion iu the passage re-
sembling viii 192 sqq. I do not think that Heinrich is·right
in taking ceper vigilando together. lcrrryuor is constantly
used for a disease, illuess ; lerrynida aaroni 122. peperit is
an aorist Compare Plin. Epp. vii 27. inhabitantibus tristes
diraeque noctes per aretum afflictantur, capitione nimbata . . .
sequebatur. 234: rneritoriu are lougingS, like contraraie, x
18. They are joined together by Suetonius, who, iu speaking
of the poverty ol Vitellius at one time of his life, gives aa
an instance that, on leaving Rome, he put his wit'e and
children arteritorie eoerzacnlo into a rented ledging. 235:
ringens opibus, ‘⁴ Ce n’est quit prix d’argent qu'on dort eu
cette ville,'' Boileau, in his imitation. And so it is generally
taken. Ι prefer, however, taking it us “rich rnen,'’ as also at
ix 100, His opalus rrunrqtram curn <sl (rrrrrena rtnenr'. “Les
grandes furtunes’' is similarly used, and κτήματα sor “rich
men,'⁷ Soph. Ant. 782, viritas “strong men ’' in xr104. For
the general sentiment conreyed in this passage, compare rl'ec
regit-andi, Sparsa, aec quincenti Ia iride lecns eal preripere, hlart
xii 57, aud again xii 68, and Hor. Epp. i 17 (r 3 compare dur.
