de Opil. Del 149: Seneca distinguishes between animus
and anima. Animum perducere ad eerriernpiiorrcm animae, Epp.
4, and again in Epp. 58 3 and Lucretius, at some length,
Bk iii. 151: sqq. Compare with this Lucret. v 1018,
Trcrrc ci amicitiam coeperant jrcnycre evenus Finitimi inter se nee
laedere aee violare, &e3 aad cio. de lavent. i 2. dispersos
homines ia ayris . . . impulit anam in locam et congregarit,
dra, pro Cestio. 42. 160: sqq. Compare Hor. Epod.7 y
rr 12, Neque bic Iapis oros aee fail leonibus Numquam, aisi iri
disperseris. Juvenal seems to have taken his natural history
«from Pliny, Leonam serires inter se neo dimicat, serpentum
morsrrs aon perit serpentes, ne araris pridem belluae ac pisces nisi
in diversa yencra saeviant. At Hercule horridi plurima es hanine

, sarii mala, H. N. vii, Proem.; or from Seneca, whose ninety·

fifth epistle he had certainly read, Nori pedet homines, mitissi-
mangenas, pandere sanquine alterno, bella yerere gerendaque
liberis tradere, crim inter se eiiam matis ae feris paz sit? and de
Ira ii 8. M. Seneca, in Controv. ii 9, neqrrc feris iader sc bella
seni. 163: tiaris, iipride=tiger, as well as tigress, the
form being (in the poets) feminine. cogn. mac, a pieturesque
expression. Meinertz Vind. J nv. p. 3², thinks it impossible
that any one ean take this otherwise thanfera, similis maculis,
parcit coycraiis .· mac. being tha descript. oblat. But this isvery
tarne. 165: sqq. blan is not satisfied norvadays with

’ forging swords (considering that the old smiths did not know

how to make them), but, besides killing people‚ some nations
go so far as to eat them. Iput a semicolon after fabri, and
talre curn rastra. . . sobri as a digression. The idea here
conveyed is a very aldone. It was in the age of brass, says
Aratus that men, first κακόεξγονεχαλκὲυσαντομάχαιςαν. 173:
Pythagoras, Hor. Sat. ii 6 63 5 ld. Epp. i 12 21. The story
ol his abstaining from beans is probablya lable‚ Aul. Gell.
iv 113 bnt Juvenal, here as elsewhere, follows the common
tradition.
