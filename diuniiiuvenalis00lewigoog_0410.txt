INTRODUCTION TO SATIRE XVI.

—4- ⁸

A FRAGMENT on military life. Such are its advantages over
the life of the civssinn, the poet says that he almost feels
inclined to enlist in the army. Saldiers may assauli their
sallon-citizens with impunity3 and if the latter seek redress
from the officers, they only go srom the frying-pan inho the
fire. These soldiers enjoy an immense advantage in having
their disputes ah once decided by a court of their own3
whereas civilians are ground down by the law’s delay. They ι
have also certain privileges in the way of disposing oi their
property. . . . The Satine ends abruptly.
