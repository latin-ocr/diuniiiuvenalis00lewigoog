162 NOTES.

Suet. Otho, 12. Tertullian de Cultu Feminarum, uses the
sarno word as Juvenal, affigitis procurro neseio paco enmmr'·
. teter sutilium et textilium capillamentorum auree tn palem mo·
dam, &a Messalina pnts on a flaxen wig, because that was
the lashionable colour sor tlte hair ol girls and women at

121: This is generally rendered “She entered tlte brothel'
warm with the old patchwork quilt'' Heinrich takes centorio

’ to be “a eloth hung up before the doors, keeping the air out

of the cells and the reeking moisture in'' Compare Mart xi
45 3, Contentus non es soritas, oelopne seraone, and again i 35 5,
At meretrix cttqn testem cetoque seroque, where the commen·
tators explain celo by “velo ex centonibus januae apposito, ne
per forium rimas intropisci possit'’ In Peteon. 7, tt in lactem
secretiorem caninius, centonem artas urbano rejecit, the word cento
clearly has this meaning, which I have little doubt is the cor·
rect one here. 122: cellum. Some of tlre stews at Rome

tlrese,'' continues Gifford, “ was written the name, and in sorno
cases, the price of the tennnts.'' This is what Martial alludes

Sat. ii 7 48, and the passage in Petron. 7, part of which has
been quoted above, tt c'n locam secretiorem pertimescentem

- arcies ortena, rejecit et Ilic, inquit, debes habitare. Cumepc neparem

me capnoscere doraum, rideo quosdam inter titulos nudusque mere-
trices snrtim compatientes. Tarde, trama jona sero, intellexi mc in
fornicem esse dedentem ,· compare Tac. Ann. xv 37, scorta cise-
bantnr niudis corporibus, and Dio. 79 13 (of Elagabalus) γυμνός
rt citi iai τῆς trigae circi ἑστὼς tace? ai nigrae, and he shooka
curtain (ocelim), which appears to the same as cento here, cf.
, Juv. xi 171-173. 123: curctis means that they were
