ciboque cyresti vescendo citum cripcboat, Vitruv. ii l. Cic. de
Inv. i 2, &a 7: Cyatlria, the mistress of Propertius, to
ἢ whom many ol his elegies are addressed. The other woman
alluded to in acc tibi, dc, is the mistress of Catullus, on the
death of whose pet sparrow, he wrote the well-known lines,¹
beginning Passer arntuus cst mccc puellae Quem plus illo oculis
suis uocabatCatull. 3. That this poem was popular with the .
Romans is evident from Martiali 8 aud 110, vii 14, xi ὁ,
iv 14, xiv 77. Juvenal says the rough women of the earliest
eges were very different from such “petites maitresses'' as
the sweethearts of Catullus arrd Propertius. Cyn. and Lesb.
were assumed names. Apul. Apol. 10 gives the name of the
former as Hostia, and of the latter as Clodia, whom it has
been sought to identily with the sister of the famous P.
Clodius Pulcer. See Ellis, Proleg. Catull. p. 55. 8: cs·
stinctus passer, i 163 note. The young Roman ladies delighted
in small birds, Or. Met. 1:261. 10: as tetrico tristior ipso
eico, Mart. i 6 3²· 11: orbe novo coctoque renati. This is
imitated from Lucretius v 907, tellure noco coctoque renuti.
12: One of the early legende represented men as coming
out of the trunks of trees. Gens cirum truncis ct doro robore
noto, Virg. Aen. viii 315: compare Ov. Met. x 503, sqq.

14-24: Some traces of modesty may have remained
even in the time of Jupiter, but it must have been before he
, had grown up and got a heard, and before there were Greeks
ready to srvear by anything ; she soon flew back to heaven
again. Juvennl’s contempt for the Greeks hasbeen shown
in Sat. iii; and will appear again, abundantly, in the course ·
of this Satire. 16: To su'ear by the head was very

common in Latin, cf. Hor. Sati 1 1-3 (quoted by Macleane),
and 108 109 of the same satire. Neruo ertrclit cum curbis . . .
