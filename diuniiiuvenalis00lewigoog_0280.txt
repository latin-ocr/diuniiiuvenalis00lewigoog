pounded of tres and actara. It occurs nowhere else. 191,

Mamerci were a family in the Aemilia gens who, like all the
other Aemilii, traced their descent from Numa They were
extinot, or had at any rate disappeared from history, when
Juvenal wrote alapas are here “stage-slaps,” such us are
administered in our pantomimcs by clown to pantaleon. O

191: sqq. I am very nearly reading cavarocca here, iram a
conjecture of Dobree's which ltibbeelr has adopted. It would
make the sense clear, and I think it might stand for “iser-
vices‚’' “favours.'' Howevcr all the best MSS. have semera

thus. gladios is evidently “a violent death,’' cf. 195, note,
and then (194 being obviously spurious) we shall get this,-
“ What matters it at what price they soll their lives in the

even to going upon the stage, would not the former bespreler·
