Daniel Hence Chaldaei came to be applied por excellence, as
here, to all sorcerers aud magicians from the East; cf. x 93

speaks ol the great honour in which this sacred fountain was ·

held, and he couples it, as here, with Delphi. The three
'greatest oracles ol ancient times were those ol Dodona,
Delphi, and Jupiter Hammon. Lucretius, Ovid, luc, speck
ol the lountain being cold by day, aud warm by night-a
legend which Moore has reproduced in his ‘⁴ Irish Melodies.''
555 : Delphis oracula cessant. The oracle had been plundered
by Nero. It was restored by Hadrian, and finally put a stop
to by Theodosius. 558, 559: These lines are omitted by

and Riddle in their Dictionary. The word may bear that
sense in two passages ol Martial, but not here. The meaning
is, no professional fortune-teller will get the credit for being

“Cyclas’' as Macleane has it. There was no one island ol
that name. 564: contigit, 217, note. caruisse, “to have
