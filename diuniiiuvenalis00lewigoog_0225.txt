they are abroad,'’ seems wrong. The woman is supposed to
be at Rome throughout. 576: numeris Thrasylli ¹So

father and son, the former t'he intimate friend of Tiberius.
577: ad primam lapidem, “as far as the first mile-stone.¹’ The
Roman roads had mile-stones like ours. They are repeatedly
mentioned by Martial, sometimes as lapides: Quo to lis deci·
mas ducit ab urhe lapis, iv 57 4, sometimes as marmora: Octa
cum domino marmor chorbe iepil (viator), ix 65 4, sometimes
simply with the number ad quartario, iii 20 18. ’ 581: Pelo·
siris, an early Egyptian astrologer, who, in conjunctiora with
Necipsos, an Egyptian king, iras said to be the founder of
, the art of easting nativities.

582-591: A person in a humble station goes to the
Oinous, aud consults one of the vulgar fortune-tellers that are ,
to be found there, instead of one of the fashionable charlatans,
who are summoned to the honses of the rich. There is force
in Maoleane’s remark that this passage 582-591, ought rather
to come after 568 and before 569-581. lt relatos to persons
who consult astrologers‚ whereas in 569-581, the poet has
done with this olnae, and posses on to those who have got astep
further, who no longer consult others, but are themselves con·
sulted as authorities. But if the transposition were made, a
still stronger difficulty would ¹arise from 591 sqq, Hae lonico,
“These (poor women),however, nc. ;'' which clearly refer to the
persons mentioned in 582-591, and would be unintelligible
after 569-581. We must therefore leave the passage alone.
⁴582: The Circus was full of these “ gipsies,''as we should call
. them. Ennius, quoted by Cicero de Div. i 58, speaks of the dc
circo astrologos, and Horace for this reasonoalls it fallacem circum,
Sat i 6 113· = alr-imque melorum. These “ geals,'' were three
pillars at each end of the syriam or low wall running length·
ways down the course in the Circus, round which the chariots
had to turn. An engraving of thern will be found in the Diet.
