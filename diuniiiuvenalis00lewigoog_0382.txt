SATIRE XIV. 359

hare been thrown on the floor, also, at the eod ol dinner,
after which the scraps, fallen crambe, dre, were awept up.
Senec. Controv. ²5· At Trimalchio's bouquet, it is scented,
Petron. 68. The enodius wonld be about oue English
gallon.

70, 71: Bentley, speaking os this passage, says, “Vah,
quam inflecte et inconcinna repetitio est patriae, patriae,·''
and he proposes patribus in the first line, Bentl. ad Hor. Od.
iii 6 20. .To me, on the contrary, it seems that the repetition
is highly forcible (and certainly in J uveaal's manner, x 103
104, note). ‘⁴ We are much obliged to you for giving another
citizen to the country, if you take care that he is usefnl to the
country.'’ Compare viii 28, raras Cieis, et eyreyias, palatae cote·
lingis wanti. 74: institues. The Fr. iastileteer still exhibits
this precise sense of the word. With regard to nlrat follows,
Pliny informs us that storks were so much csteemcd for de·
stroying serpente, that in Thessaly it was a capital effence to
hill one ol thero, H. N. x 2 3. Virg. Georg. ii 320. 77:

drawn from natural history, follows popular tradition.
Beavers do not mutilate themselves, xii 34. Ants do not
lay up stores lor winter, vi 361. , Cranes have not got talons,
xiii 169. Elephants do not slred their trrshs when they have
grown too heavy, xi 126. Nor is it likely that they were
ever found in Arabia. Probably there were no bears in ’
Africa, iv 100. Tigers and bears do fight aurong each other,
xv 161 ; and it may be added that vultures build on rocks,
and not iu trees, as here represented. J uveual might, hon·-
ever, plead in excuse, as to the last error, the example of
Phaedrus, who maltos a similar mistake about eegles, Aquilo
ia sublimi quercu realem secaret, ii 4; arrd ol Ovid, who also
represents vultures as building in trees, Am. i 12 20.
