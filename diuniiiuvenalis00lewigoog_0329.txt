INTRODUCTION TO Sthllll Xl.

——4—

. Art invitation to his friend Persicus to dine with him during
the festival of the Megalesia. After censuring the gluttony
of men who could not afford the delicacies to which they
treated themselves, aud whom their belly often reduced to

, beggary, the poet dwells on the necessity of “ cutting one's

coat to the sizo of one's cloth,” as we say. Hc theu describes
the diuner which he proposes to set before his friend, by way
of showing that his practice agrees with his precepts‚ a young
leid, asparagus, egge, fowls, and fruit. This would have been ·
considered a luxurious dinner in the old times-the sim-
plicity of which he proceeds to contrast with the luxury of
his day. Comiug bach, after a long digression, to his diuner,

he says his friend will find no luxurions commodities‚ such as -

ivory, iu his house. The bundles of the lruives are of boue.
There will be no carver and house-steward. Two plainly-
dressed and well-behaved young slaves will wait at table aud
serve the wine. There will beno danciug-girls‚ ortomfoolery
of that kind-amusements to be left to the rich. Instead of
that, Virgil or Homer will be read aloud. Iu conclusion, the
poet begs his friend to cast off all care when he enters his·
doors, and to enjoy his holiday, while the silly people outside
are all ssocking to the Circus and the gamos.

There is nothing in ,this Satire to indicate its date, except
the allusion to the poet’s age, 201-203. See notes t064
aud 204. ·
