personal appearance.’' But if Nero himself was bald, Juvenal
would never have called Domitian, “a hald edition ol Nero,‘'
and we have no authority whatever lor supposing that Nero
was anything of the kind. On the contrary, Suetonius, who

notes all these little points of personal appearance, says that

fact that arados does sometimes mean “with only a tunic on ”
(ii 71, note), extraordinary efforts are made hy commentatore
