de Ira, iii 20. 649, 650: ut sema . . . recedit, describes a
landslip. The antecedent to puibns seems to be sara quihus ,
raons subtrahitur from which the mountain (so to speak) with-
draws its support, slips away. cliuo tatas pendente recedit,
“from tbe hanging slope its side recedes,'' ia, “is thrown
further bach’' Not that the side slips off, as some take it.
paribus might indeed go with recedit as well as with subtrahitur,
“ from which the mountain is withdrawn, and from which its
side recedes ;'' but the other is better. 653: Alcestim.
Alcestis, who devoted herself for her husband Admetus.
655: Belides, tho Danaides, daughters ol Danaus, and the
granddaughters ol Belus. Their story is well known. Eri· ·
phple betrayed her husband Amphiaraus and her son. 654:

opposed to pulmone rubetae, insulsam et fatuam to teneri, and
deutra laeuaque tenebat to apitur. Clytemnaestra used an axe,
a bunghng, senseless instrument, laying about, right and lef ,

of a toad3 of. i 70. Another account made a sword the instru-
ment oi the murder. AEsch. Ag. 1506. Eur. Eleot 163.
bipennem insulsam et futuam. Valer. Flaca has docta bipenni
(the best reading, another is diaeta), i 122. The ancients, like
thamoderns, often personified inanimato objects, applying to
them epitheta which are proper to sentient beings. Ol this '
,practice we hare many examples in Juvenal, with whom it

was a lavaurite: aneia epistola, iv 149 ; audaces carinas, x 2643
miranti aratro, xiii 6 5 ; irato sistro, xiii 9 33 esuriens ramus, xiii
