SA TIRE X. 307

Scholars need not be informed how osten Servius, rho„ mis·
quote lines3 and there are cases where ewen a wrong author
is cited. To give but one instance, Seneca, Nat. Quaest. iw
2, quotes partos a pentameter from Ovid, which is to be
found in Tibullus. Iseo no difficulty at all in habes, though
Macleane says “I can make nothing satisfactory of ir.” We
must put a comma alter prudentia, and rhen the poet turns to
Fortune and addresses her direerly (compare iv 123 124, xiii
80 81, vi 466, vi 7, the commonest possible triek wirh the
poets), ‘⁴ Yon have no divine power over ns il we are only
gifted with prudence. In is we men who make a goddess
of you, OFortnne.'’ numen for “divine authority '² is very
common, at credo mea aanrirro tandem Fessa jacent, Virg. Aen.
vii 297, &o.; numeri historiar, “ t-he divine power of history,’'
Plin. Epp. ix ²7 ; sermoque numen holel, Ov. Am iii 3⁷12,
nnnwrr Senatus in cie These lines are repeated, in part, in
Sal. xiv. virgil has something nor altogether nnlihe the

second clause in its boldness‚ on sua reique Deus fil diro ’

cepido? May not a man's own desires become agod to hihi
Compare Juv. xiii 863 Plin. H. N. ii 73 and very much the
idea of the first clause is oonweyed in cic. Balb. 4, r'rr qno arro
ito mammo fortuna cam summo virtute coriarii, rd ornnem judicio
pho honriar' qaam deor tribueretur.
