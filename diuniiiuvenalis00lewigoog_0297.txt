276 NOTES.

nec deerit qui, iii 30² 303. 113: viriosas inebriet aurem, a
striking and original expression: asis the man breathed his
tipsiness into your ear. lt is a wonder that the commen-
tators have allowed it to be genuino, wi 543, note. Ears are
termed bibulae by Persius, and sitientes by Cic. ad Au. ii 14
117: Saufeia occurred at vi 320. pro populo secere is to
sacrifice on behals of the people at the rites of Bona Dea. ·
This was done by the l'estal virgins, cf. Aul. Gellius, i 1²3
and Saufeia is represented as assisting. Seneca, Epp. 97, of
Clodius, uiolatis religionibus ejus sacrficii quod pro populo fieri
dicitur, and Cic. ad Att. i 13, of the same affair, cum apud
Caesarem pro populo fieret. facere for to sacrifice is not
uncommon, Virg. Ecl. iii 77. rem ¹‹Ic'ra'aara sarcre, or sacra
jacere were the full terms. erreis and ’ρὲζω are similarly used
in Gr. Pliny informs us that Greek wiues were excluded from

' use in sacred rites because they contained a portion of water,
H. N. xiv 19. Saufeia would drink pure wine, merram. We
have seen from several passages in Sat ri 300, 318·319, 425,
sqq, the horror with which Juvenal regarded the tippling pro-
pensities of women, a sentiment which again breaks out in this
line. An admirer ol ancient times, such as ho shows himself
to bo, would, il possible, be more shocked than we are at female
drunkonness. For in the good old days, Roman women were
not allowed eren to taste wine, riui usus olim Iloreunis feminis
agnotus suit, Val. Max. ii r. This statement is confirmed hya
host of writers, among others by Pliny, H. N. xiv 13, whom
Tertullian follows, Apol. 6. ·

123: is, in all probability, spurious. 126-129:
sentinat . . . senectus. Heinrich says these are fine verses
No doubt, but decurrere does not go well with floscrdus or-
portio. In lact, a flower running down is on a par witha
voice shiningin the darkness: which Cicero treats usto in De
Lag. Agr. i 8. Many other instances might-be given of the,

. carelessness of the best Roman authors in handling their
metaphora 128: unguento, perlumes, as is well known,
were esteemed by the Romans as among tho greatest luxu-
ries of lile. Catullus says, jestingly, of some which he pro·
niises to a guest, :ingerentum dubo quod meuc puellae Doauruat
l'cuerts Cupidinesque Quod tu cum olfaciet Deos rogabis Totum nt
