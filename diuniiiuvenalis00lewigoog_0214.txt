sarran vs. 193

Nostra sed impugant, nos nostraque lividas odit, Ep. ii 1 86
87.v 451: Opicne, iii 207. 452: colommmam, ci. Mart.
xi 19 quoted above, Quaeris car nolim te discere Gallo l' deses-ta
es,· saepe soloecismum mentula nostrasncit. This certainly looks
likea parody oi Juvenal. The eleventh book oi Martial must
be referred to the reign oi Trajan, and was most likely written ·
in or about hp. 100, and there is nothing in this date to render ’
an imitation impossible. On the word soloecismus, cl. Aul.
Gell v 20. 454-456: That is to say, she should dress like
a man, sacrifice to Silvanus, the god oi husbandmen, and go to
the public baths, along with the males: which last act oi inde·
cency, it would seem, was sometimes witnessed, 374, note.
457—474: Rich women seem to think they may permit
*themselves anything. They solten their complexione with
bread-poulticcs‚ ior the sake oi their lovers, not their hus-
bands. They enamel their faces, and plaster themselves with
all sorts of pigments and ointmenta 458: uirides gemmas
would be, Ι suppose, emeralds or jaspers. Claudiam 'says oi a
bride, viridique aszyustat iaspide pectas. prandes viridi mem
lesse smaragdi, Lucret. iv 1126, Tibull. ii 4 ²7· Emeralds
occupied the same rank as they do with us, being next but
one to the diamond, the pearl, however, being second, instead
oi the ruby. At least, so it appears from Pliny. 459:
elenchi were, according to Pliny, long tapering pearls ending
ina bulb-a formos earring common among us, H. N. ix 3 5.
460: For the same sentiment, cl. Mart. viii 12. Plautus
illustrates it very happily in the Aulul. iii-5 24-30. This
line has, of course, been considered spurious. Jahn and Rib-
beck propose to put 461-463 aiter 464-466. Macleane says,
“ Interea is not otherwise very intelligible.” It seems to me
to offer no difficulty. There is nothing which a rich woman
will not permit herself, says J uvenal, a woman who puts ou
oostly neoklaces and wears precious enrrings. In the mean·-
while, she makes up her face with all sorts oi cosmetics.
Putting on the jewels is the last abt oi the completed tossette,
and interea (the French “en attendant'’) refers to the prc-
parations mado at home, the secrets oi the dressing-table,
which are next spoken oi. 460 is thrown iu parentlretically‚

quite aiter the manner oi the poet. See below, 531. nd
