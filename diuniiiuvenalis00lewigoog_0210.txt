SATIRE Vl. 189

canis, De Ira. iii 37, and Petron. 72, and M. Senec, of carris ud
ostiam alligatas, Controv. 30; Tibull. ii 4 3² 343 and citen-

elsewhere. The rich, indeed, seem generally to bave kepta ’

dog chained up in the ostium, or janua. Hence, the naming,
‘⁶ Cave canem,” in Petron, and to be seen at Pompeii. Pro·
bably the humbler classes also kept them. This poor man
perhaps rents one ol the tabernae, or shops, attached to the
‘great house, and besides barring his shutters (iii 304) keeps
a dog for greater security. The poet bas told us ot iii 2 35
that moysis opibus dormitur irc orbe, and herois an illustration
ol the truth ol this. Caligula, according to Sueton, when
disturbed by people taking their places in the circus at night, ἱ
called for cudgels, like the lady here; fustibus coepit, Calig. 26.
415: remoto, might mean “is prevailed upon only to beat
them.'’ 419: conchas, 304. Jars for oils and perlumes'
It seems to have been usual for rich people to go to thabatha
witha great retinue. So, in the next satire, one who wants
to pass for rich cecat lutulenta balnea trrrbu, vii r 313 and n‘e
read in Lucian of ir τοῖς βαλανείοις rb πλῆθος τῶν ἑπομένων, Nigri·
nus 34- 4201210cte. It would seem from this that, in
. J uveual's day, some at least ol the public baths were open at ’
night. In later times the usage, on this head, appears to
have varied. Lamprid. Alex. Sev. 24 Vopisc. Tac. 10.
421: proci massa. These were probably lclteres, leaden
weights, corresponding very nearly to our “dumb-bells'’
Graves. . . balterus sacili rotat lacerto (ol a woman), Mart.
vii 67 5, and xiv 49, Sen. Epp. 56. The firstnamed epigram
bears a close resemblance, in parts, to this passage 422,
423: cristae has the same sense as pecten in 370. aliptes, she
takes her own anointerwith her. She has been accompanied
by a great retinue, 419 420. Hence dominae is “his mis-
tress.'’ With 423 compare Mart. rii 67. Uncti cadere rcprrlat
magistri, and iii 82 13 14. Percurrit agili corpus arte tractu-
triarllarrumque doctam spargit omatibus membris, and Seneca, Epp.
56, says of the aliptes ,· aridio crepitum illisue marma hunrerr's‘,
quae, prout plana persenit aut concava, ita sonum matut, and
again, alicam pro acclamare cogit. 424: We must suppose
that some people have been invited to supper ; humble de·
pendants, probably of the same kind as Trebius, in Sat v.
