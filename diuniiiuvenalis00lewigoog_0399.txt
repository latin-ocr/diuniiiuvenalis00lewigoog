INTRODUOTION ΤΟ Shllllll XV. ’

-4-——-

Tms Satire is directedagainst the Egyptians. The poet, ’
efter expressing his contempt for their superstitious, relates
an event which receutly occurred in their country, The
Ombites were celebrating a festival, when their neighbours‚
the Tentyrites, surprised them, and, being victorious in the
encounter, cut to pieces the only oue of the enemy—who fell
into their hands, and ate him raw. ,

The poet says that instances have occurred before this of
men euting each other, but that has been under compulsion,
os in the cose of besieged citios. These Egyptians surpass in
ferocity tho most savage tribes. Some very beautiful rossec·
tions on the origin ol civil society, and a contrast drawn
between man ond the lower animale, very much in favour
ol the latter, conclude the Satire.

Line 27 (lilre xiii 17) furnishes aerucial date lor this Satine .
and its author. Unlortunately we cannot fix it with certainty.
119 hl). is, l think, the date of the event referred to, which
would bring this Satire to about the same period as xiii.
