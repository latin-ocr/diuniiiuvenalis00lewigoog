finem atque initiam leeeis eeiyuc discrimine internosces, Tac. Agr.
12. 163: sqq. Refereuce is here made to some event, like

Gracchus’s marriage above, not otherwise known. 164:
= canetis, i. q., coactis caeter-is, as often. maeetussrmulosamsestem
coactis vastiorem, Appul. iii 61, where, as elsewhere, the writers
of some of the MSS. have interpolated caeteris. cf. Juv. viii
97 and 1166 teto φερε neollier. 164: optetis is eword

’ taken srom the Greek, and is here, 1 think, applied to the ·

companions of Zalates, who were Orientale. Ide not think
the meaning is “ more soit than any of the Roman youth,’' for
that could hardly be said. They were foreigners, and Juvenal
uses a term of foreign origin in speaking of thern. As for
their being worse than the Roman youth, the poet is, on the
contrary, urging that if they stay long enough, not Zalates g
alone, hut the rest of them, will take back praetextatos mores,
“the manners ot the young Il-ornaus.'’ 168: compare ix
130, numquam pertitinet tili deerit ctericus Sinrilarly at iii 303,
deerit is a dissyl: so deesse in Lucret i 43, and electatemt in
Virg. Bne. vii. 7 etc. 169: te‘accee, “breeches'' cf.
Diet. G. and R, Ant, where an engraving is given. Tacitus
calls them berberem teymea, Hist. ii 20. barbam tegmine
aarum, Aen. xi 777. 169: mittemur “will be sent to the
right about,'' as we should say. They will abendon their
native costume and their manly sports. Heinrich takes

mittentur to mean “will be sent them as presente (by their ·

lovers) ;'’ butthis seems to me certainly wrong. 17οε
aestro eitic tete eeyeeter, says Pliny, Epp. iv 22. Some
render, “ So Artaxata inritatos the mannerS‚'' &e 3 in which
case Artaxata will be the nominative. Por ecferre, to recall,
unitate, cf. ico. 1 prefer the translation I hare given, as
most in lrarrnony with the context. referant is “they carry
