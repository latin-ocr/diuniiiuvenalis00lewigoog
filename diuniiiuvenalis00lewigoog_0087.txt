occurs again at iii 203, bnt in an entirely different connection.
7οε topan- the tayn, iu 'place ol the stola, appears from several
passages to have been the dress ot prostitntes, and it seems
that married women convicted ot adultery were sometimes
condemned to wear it. Horace oppones aratroaa to anana
hyatu, Sat. i 2 63, and again 81 82, tcaemm estsemur aut artas

traeted. The sense here is, “Adulteressasshe is proredtobe,
and condemned to wear a toga, she would shrink, even in her
degradation, from wearing such an indecent garment aa that

merely “one dressed in a tunic only‚’' as it does in some ,
places, and as Heinrich takes it here. 72-74: “A pretty
dress ior the old Romans, our glorious ancestors, to have seen

habitante of the Palatine Hill‚ the most anciently settled part

some render, but “ recently,'' as below 160. This is, mercarer,
indicated by aartaailas crudis. positis aratris might mean that
