280 INTRODUCTION TO SATIRE X.

cause of his death.

Are men then to pray for nothingf Yes, for virtue and
moral qualities‚ leaving to the gods to decide the rest. They
know what is good for us better than we do ourselves.

There is no passage in this Satire from which we cau infer =
its date. Line 136 hasbeen applied by some to the Column
of Trajan3 but this is worse thau fauciful. Au arch is spoken
of and not a column. Arches abounded in Rome, and many
of them were covered with bas-reliefs. The reference is .
general. Mr. Evans thinks that the sustained majesty and
dignified flow of languagc of this Satira and its philosophical

tube admitted, I should like to conjecture the other way3
that it is au early work, smaclring of the declamator, while

This is the first of Ribbech's disputed Satires, cf. Introduc·

with a maturet experience of the world, he lashed the vices

·of his own country and of his own day3 aud such compositions ·
would require a somewhat different mode of treatment, and
would, from their very nature, deal with what was passing ·
