Tms Satire requires no words by way of introduction.
Mr. Evans seems to think ie one of the author’s late pre
ductione from the mention of Pollio 6 7, and Saufeia 117, in
much the same terms as those which are applied to them in the
eleventh and sixth Satires respectively‚ xi 43, vi 320, and both

of these letter bear evidence of being the works of the poet's
maturer years. I think it doubtful, however, whether these
are more then names.
