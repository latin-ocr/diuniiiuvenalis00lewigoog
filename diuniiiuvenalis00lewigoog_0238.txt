SATIRE Vll. 217

than a poet, and from the fact ol llartial addressing Juvenal

as jocunde luvenalis, vii 91, it has been inferred that “Martial

’ knew nothing ol his poetical studies.'’ Yet Martial applies
the epithet socundus to poets constantly, cl. Introduction,
and in addition to the passages cited there, compare Stat.
Silv. 1 24, facundum letor, and Stat. silv. 1 3 r, in conjunc·
tion with lines 22 13. Horace uses jocundio ofa Poet, A. P.
41, and Oalpnrn. has socundus Apollo. iv 87.

old house in which to recite. (lomp. with what follows Tac.

lonyc'sst'me occur in this sense: also lorpe oola. And Servius

he difficolt to assign any other meaning to the word here.
Otherwise it must mean “Ata long 'distance,'' “ In an cut of

argument that a word is not found elsewhere in precilely the
same sense is of very little avail against a context showing
what the author did mean. And the same holds good oi con·
structione So the passage iv 15 3-r 5 5 wouldbe quite clear,
even if we had not preserved to us accidentally two passages
to show that jaculari a capella is perlectly good Latin. See
ad loc. 43: scildore. Compare Pers. i 54 scis comitem
