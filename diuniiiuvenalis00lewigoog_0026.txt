INTRODUCTION. ς

The great difficulty in connection with this lile is, that,
at first sight, the only event in it which we are able to
test is impossible. If, that is to say, the actor at whose
instance Juvenal, eightyyears old, was banished from Rome
be taken-as he has generally been taken—sor the Paris 01
Domitian, then the whole narrative is envelopcd iu a cloud
01 fable. There were two celebrated actors named Paris in
tlre first century, the more recent of whom (the one hero ⁴
alluded to) was put to death by Domitian at the begin·
ning 01 his reign. Yet it is certain, from his own writings,
that Juvenal was alive, and composing satiras, and appa-
rentlyin Rome,several years alter thedeath 01 that emperor,
and some twenty years aster the death 01 Paris.

v This difficulty was seen at a very early period, and
accordingly in one MS. at tha end 01 a life which, with
a few variations is the sameas that gii en above, we find
the words alter brectanorum tempus, leit out, and the
following substituted: “ debr αὐτὸς adscribitur Divorum
choro, revertiturque J uvenalis Romam, qui tandem ad
Nervae et Trajaui principatum supervivens senio et taedio
vitae consectus properantem spiritum cum tussi exspuit,’'
aa, Domitian dies, and Juvenal comes back to Rome, arrd
lives into Trajan's time. According to this, he must have
been writing satiras when be was a hundred years 01 age,
a supposition which may at once be dismissed. Another
life makes him come back to Romo, and die 01 grief
because he did not find his friend Martial there (a story
which the grammarian who wrote it evidently “ evolvod'’
from the fact that Juvenal is named three times by
Martial) ; another makes him live in exile till the time 01
Antoninus Pius3 another rualres Trajan the emperor who
orders his banislrmeut (to Seotland, not Egypt), upon which
he dies 01 the slrock. These lives may corno from one or
moro common sources3 they are oi little or no value3 but
it must bo observed that thoy all agree as to the fact 01
J uvenal's bauishment, disseriug srom each other only as ⁴
