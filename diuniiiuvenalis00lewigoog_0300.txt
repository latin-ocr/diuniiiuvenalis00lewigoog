Tms is a Satine on the wanity of human wishes, and the poet
says that there are few people who know what is good for
them. Men pray for all sorts of things, which, when obtained,
only serve to ruin them: eloqucuce, personal strength, great
fortune and the lilro. The millionnaire Seneca, Lateranus and Ι
others, perish at the hiclding of a tyrant. 'Poor men hare
,nothing to seor. How Democritus would have laughed if he
could have witnessed some of the sights of Rome,-a triumph,
ior instance, with the consul in his chariot and a slave behind
him to warn him that he is but a mortal!
’ The example oi Sejanus is then cited as showing the perils
to which successful ambitionis exposed, and alife-like pertrait
is introduced of the citizens trembling and whispering together .
as his corpse is dragged past hythe executioner. “Would
it not be far better to be a country police-magistrate than
Sejanusl'' aslis the poet. Then Pompey and Crassus and
Julius Caesar are mentioned, Cicero and Demosthenes, the
, oratore, Hannibal, Alexander, Xerxes, the warriors, all of
whom are made to point his moral. ’
“Everjone is praying for long life, above all thinge.''
Well, but what dees this long lile entaill The poet gives a
striking picture ol extreme old age, its decrepitude of body
and mind, its utter loneliness. He cites Nestor and Prieni.
How much better for these men if they had died at an earlier
period! And the same may be said ol Marius and Pompey.
Then mothers pray that their children may be beautiful.
But to what perils will not beauty exposo thoml Look at
Lucretia and Virginis. llandsome youths are exposed to
dengers no less formidable. Loolr at Hippolytus and Belle·
