so mrtem, ambasiacensem. 163: pereussos Achilles may
be rendered “the death of Achilles.” Numerone instaures
of this common Latin construction are to bc found in Juvenal:

remque Neoptolemum moerore tueamur, Aen ii 5493 plenam Nerone
propinquo, Juv. viii 72, full of his relationship to Nero. You
may choose such themes as Virgil chose, and Statius and
Valerius Flaccus. 165: scarie Lucilios arbeae, Pers. i 114,
