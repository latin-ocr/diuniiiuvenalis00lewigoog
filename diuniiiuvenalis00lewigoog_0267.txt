Lucret, es. has n kindred meaning, “universal feeling common
to all alihe,'' cf. Munro ad i 422. 'tt-78: It is asad thing
to have to leun for support on the reputation ol others, like a
roos propped up by pillnrs, or asine longing to cling to an elm.
Here the roof and the vine represent the man himself, and the
pillars and the elm correspond to oliorum samoe. The Romans,
us is well known, were in the habitos training their vines
round poplene, elms, arrd ashes, Colum. de Arb. 16 3 Or. Anu
ii 16 41, Clinns urrini eiicere, citis non deserit silenum, Hor. Epod.

29, where tideus is rather “virgin'' astho plane-trec is called
cocleis‚,Od. ii 15 43 and eidno, Mart. iii 58 3, from the fact

that, owing to iss deuse foliage, vines were not trained round ι

it. Here viduus is not easily translatable, “the vine, as it
trails along the ground, longs in vain for some unwedded elm
¹ to clingto.'' It does not mean that the vine has been torn ¹
from the elms. 79: orditer corresponds very nearly to our
arbitrator, Diet. G. and R. Ant, “ J udex.'’ Pliny expressly
distinguishes between orditer and judee. Senienim nec qui acet
jndicem uui unlitrncnsueiuni, Epp. rii 30. Caeteri enne adjudicent
wnsurn ludcsoeteri enirnodccrinnt, ud arbitrum confugiunt, Cic. pro
Rosa, aud the distinction between the two is very clearly laid
down by Seneca de Ben. iii 7, from which it appears that the
arbiter was possessed of a greater latitudo than the judee, and
was armedwith somethingvery closelyresemblingwhetwe eall
an equitable jurisdiction. Hence the more necessary for one
filling the office to be an upright man. 81: Phalaris, tyrant
of Agrigentum, with his brnzen bull, had become proverbial.

period, Plin. Epp. ii 4 ; ferinum defuncti pudoremque suscipere, ⁴
