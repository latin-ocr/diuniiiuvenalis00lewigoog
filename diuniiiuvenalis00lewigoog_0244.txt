Excolat et penninos plurima palmo soree, Mart. vii 28. Here
the poor lawyer living in a garret is supposed to decorate his
stains, scolae, in the same manner, that his neighbours‚ and
the rare clients ulio come to his chambers, may bc made
auare of his triumph. 119: sicem petasunculus, a small

'Athen Deipn.‚ a tlitch ol bacon, dried from being kept so
long; what Martial calls datius pelosa, iii 77 6. The same
poet has an epigram on the flitch oi bacon, which he classes
among the presents sent to strangers end guests, Xenia.

120: Afrorum epimenia, the monthly allowance of black

are expressly mentioned by Martial as among presents sent
at the feast oi the Saturnalia (very much aiter the sashion oi
our Christ-mas presente) to poor lawyers, iv 46 11. ’ The whole

oath that they, had paid nothing to their advocates, who
were, however, allowed to receive as much asten sestertia,
alter the decisiou ol the cause. This senatus consultum ap-
pears to have created great surprise, Plin. Epp. v 213 and
such lavvs as these were probably constantly evaded. An

you have stipulated to pay pour legal assistente. The prap-
malici were a lower kind of practicioner, who helped the advo·
cate, who “ devilled '² ior him. They were also called labelli·
ones, whence the French “tabellions '' still applied to village
notarios. Compare Cic. de Or. i 45, Ut apud Graecos inslnn
