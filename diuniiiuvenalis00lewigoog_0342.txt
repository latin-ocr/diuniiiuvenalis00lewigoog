they are fond of,'' Plin. Epp. ix 6. He adds that he himself,
as might be expected, cared not a rush for the public games.
We have heard of the fondness of the Romans in general for
them, several times, iii 22 3, ihc. F or full information regard-

“Circus,''vii113114,note. 200: puluere. According to , .

Livy, at the battle of Cannae, a great wind arose and hlew
dust in the faces of the Romans, veritus . . . adversm Romanis
