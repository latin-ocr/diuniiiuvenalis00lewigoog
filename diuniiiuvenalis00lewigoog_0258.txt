SATIRE VIII.

NOTES TO SATIRE VIII.

1: Stemmata, literally‚ “wreaths.'' The Romans seem '
not only to have had waren masks, imagines, of their ances-
tors, Ov. Fasti 591, which were carried in funeral proces-
sions, Polyb. vi 53, but also family-trees, resembling our own
iu form, on which were medallion portraits pictos valles, 2 3
imape'nes pictas, Plin. H. N. xxxv 2, encircled by wreaths,
running from one to another, alemannia, though the existence
of a family tree, with pertraits, has been disputed, and it has
been asserted that tho waxen images were connected with each
other by threads, lineis, the whole group, when so disposed,
being alone called a stemma. The above passage in Pliny,
aud another from Seneca, de Benef. iii 28, as well as Sueton.
Nero 37, and Galba 2, will bear either interpretation, as also
Mart. iv 40 ς cf. Becher, “Gallus,'' sc. ii, noto, where other
passages are given. I think it probable, however, that tho
Romans had family-trees like oure, the lahela cepae of 6, and

' cf. 7, and Pers. iii 28. In either caso, stemeuala will mean

‘³ pedigreeS,'' Mart. viii ό, Stat. Silv. iii 3 44. Pontice. Of
Ponticus nothing further is known. He may be, accordIng
to the frequent usage of Juvenal, an imaginary personage. I
am inclined to think his is asancy name, perhaps adopted
from Martial, whose poems were read as widely as the novels
of Paul de Koch in Leuis Philippe's time, long before this
Satire was published, at any rate iu its existing form. The
latter poet addresses one Ponticus in many of his epigrama,
ea ga, Hermogenes tentes mapparum, Pontice, fer est, 'xii '293'
where Ponticus seems to bc brought in as a dactyl comp.
