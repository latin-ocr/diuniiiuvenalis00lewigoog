tltcm up.’' Or-as we should say-1 won’t introduce the
names ol living persons into my serires:

All that can be said with regard to the date oi this Satire
· is, that, in its present form it must have been given to the
world later than ltu. 100, because the condemnationof Marius

Ι (le. 47 sqq.) took place in that year. But 1 should imagine ·
that the bullr of it was written before that period, aad the

lines about Marius (perhaps le 45-50) inserted afterwards as
additional illustratione. The very style of duvenal, in which
the limae labor is distinctly perceptihle,= would lead me to
suppose that the satires were frequently retouched, altered,
and added to, from time to time ; and the expression in
Suetonius' Life (see “ Introduction ''), which, at any rate,
exhibite the early tradition on the subject, points in the
same direction. The repeated introduction ol ‘⁴ informare ”
·’ and “accusers,'' such as those indicated under the nemea
tornamento, seems to me to suit rather the age of Domi-
tian than that oi Nerva and Trajan-a point which has not
received the attention which it deserves from commentatore,
who haue assigned the whole ol this Satire to adate later
Η than nn. roo. Nothing is more certain than that Trajan, at
his accession to power, banished the leading delatores, and put
an end to their trade. Pliny's Panegyricus is lull ol passages
to this effect, xxxiv. 1, 5 ; xxxv. 1, ²3 xli. r. Itis true that
both Massa and Carus are mentioned hy hlartial in his
twelfth book, published about an. 104 ; but the former is
spoken oi as a personage-of the past, Ep. 293 and with regard
to Carus, I have small doubt that this is “one of the pieces
belonging to earlier years which were included in his later
books,” a practice of hlartial's, of which we have other
oevidence3 see Professor Ramsay's article on Martial in Dict.
Gr. and Rom. Biography. Juvenal, we may be sure, would
not introduce the abuse of informers into asatlre composed
when they had ceased to exist 3 a republication of it, with
additions, would be quite another affair.
Compare also ls. 152, 153, with Tacitus' remark: roro
temporam felicitate odi sanctire quoe celis et quae sentias dicere
licet (Hist. i. ι).
